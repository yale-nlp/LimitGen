However, in the digital era, the remarkable proficiency of LLMs in generating high-quality text has also brought several issues to the forefront, including individuals impersonation (Salewski et al., 2023  ###reference_b29###), academic paper ghostwriting (Vasilatos et al., 2023  ###reference_b33###), and the proliferation of LLM-generated fake news (Meg\u00edas et al., 2021  ###reference_b22###). These issues highlight the urgent need for reliable methods to distinguish between human and LLM-generated content, particularly to prevent the spread of misinformation and ensure the authenticity of digital communication. In the light of this, LLM watermarking technology has been validated as a promising solution. By incorporating distinct features during the text generation process, LLM outputs can be uniquely identified using specially designed detectors.\nAs an developing technology, LLM watermarking urgently requires consensus and support from both within and outside the field. However, due to the proliferation of watermarking algorithms, their relatively complex mechanisms, the diversification of evaluation perspectives and metrics, as well as the intricate procedure of evaluation process, significant effort is required by both researchers and the general public to easily experiment with, comprehend, and evaluate watermarking algorithms.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce MarkLLM, an open-source toolkit for LLM watermarking. Figure 1  ###reference_### overviews the architecture of MarkLLM.\n###figure_1### Our main contributions are summarized as follows:\n1) From a Functional Perspective:\nImplementation framework: MarkLLM offers a unified and extensible framework for implementing LLM watermarking algorithms, currently supporting nine specific algorithms from two key families: KGW (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023a  ###reference_b12###) and the Christ (Christ et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###) family.\nUnified top-calling interfaces: MarkLLM provides consistent, user-friendly interfaces for loading algorithms, producing watermarked text generated by LLMs, conducting detection processes, and gathering data necessary for visualization.\nVisualization solutions: Custom visualization solutions are provided for both major watermarking algorithm families, enabling users to visualize the mechanisms of different algorithms under various configurations with real-world examples.\nEvaluation module: The toolkit includes 12 evaluation tools that address three critical perspectives: detectability, robustness, and impact on text quality. It also features two types of automated evaluation pipelines that support user customization of datasets, models, evaluation metrics and attacks, facilitating flexible and comprehensive assessments.\n2) From a Design Perspective: MarkLLM is designed with a modular, loosely coupled architecture, enhancing its scalability and flexibility. This design choice facilitates the integration of new algorithms, the addition of innovative visualization techniques, and the extension of the evaluation toolkit by future developers.\n3) From an Experimental Perspective: Utilizing MarkLLM as a research tool, we performed in-depth evaluations of the performances of the nine included algorithms, offering substantial insights and benchmarks that will be invaluable for ongoing and future research in LLM watermarking."

            "text": "LLM watermarking methods can be broadly categorized into two major families: the KGW Family and the Christ Family. The KGW Family modifies the logits produced by the LLM to generate watermarked output, while the Christ Family alters the sampling process of LLM text generation to achieve watermarking.\nThe KGW method, as described by (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023a  ###reference_b12###), involves distinguishing the vocabulary set into a green list and a red list based on the preceding token. During text generation, bias is added to the logits of green list tokens, leading to a preference for these tokens in the generated text. A statistical metric, based on the proportion of green words, is then calculated, and a corresponding threshold is set to differentiate watermarked from non-watermarked text. Building on this foundation, various modifications have been proposed to refine list partitioning or logit manipulation, aiming to improve the algorithm\u2019s performance in low-entropy settings (Lee et al., 2023  ###reference_b16###; Lu et al., 2024  ###reference_b21###), reduce the impact on text quality (Hu et al., 2023  ###reference_b11###; Wu et al., 2023  ###reference_b35###; Takezawa et al., 2023  ###reference_b30###), increase the information capacity of the watermark (Wang et al., 2023  ###reference_b34###; Yoo et al., 2023  ###reference_b37###; Fernandez et al., 2023  ###reference_b8###), counteract watermark removal attacks (Zhao et al., 2023  ###reference_b39###; Liu et al., 2024b  ###reference_b19###; Ren et al., 2023  ###reference_b28###; he2024watermarks), and enable public detection (Liu et al., 2024a  ###reference_b18###; Fairoze et al., 2023  ###reference_b7###).\nChrist et al. (2023  ###reference_b4###) introduced a method using a sequence of pseudo-random numbers to guide the sampling process in a binary LLM with a vocabulary of only 0s and 1s, resulting in detectable watermarks due to the correlation between the generated text and the sequence. On the other hand, Aaronson and Kirchner (2022  ###reference_b1###) developed a watermarking algorithm suitable for real-world LLMs, which uses EXP-sampling. In this approach, a pseudo-random sequence of real numbers  is generated based on previous tokens: , where  is a pseudo-random function. The token  is then selected to maximize  from the probability distribution  of the next token . To detect a watermark, the sum  (where ) measures the correlation between the text and the pseudo-random sequence, allowing for effective identification of watermarks by setting a suitable threshold. To further enhance robustness, Kuditipudi et al. (2023  ###reference_b15###) suggested using edit distance to evaluate the correlation for detection."

This impact can be measured by metrics such as perplexity and output diversity, and by comparing the performance of the watermarked LLM against an unaltered LLM in specific downstream tasks."

            "text": "So far, many watermarking algorithms have been proposed. However, as each algorithm implementation prioritizes its specific requirements over standardization, several issues have arisen:\n1) Lack of Standardization in Class Design: This necessitates significant effort when optimizing or extending existing methods due to insufficiently standardized class designs.\n2) Lack of Uniformity in Top-Level Calling Interfaces: The inconsistency in interfaces makes batch processing and replicating different algorithms cumbersome and labor-intensive.\n3) Code Standard Issues: Challenges include the need to modify settings across multiple code segments and a lack of consistent documentation, which complicate the customization and effective use of the algorithms. Additionally, hard-coded values and inconsistent error handling can hinder adaptability and debugging efforts.\nTo address these issues, our toolkit offers a unified implementation framework that enables the convenient invocation of various state-of-the-art algorithms under flexible configurations. Additionally, our meticulously designed class structure paves the way for future extensions. Figure 2  ###reference_### demonstrates the design of the unified implementation framework.\n###figure_2### AutoWatermark.111There is a transformers_config parameter in the .load() method, which is an instance of the TransformersConfig class containing necessary information such as the model and tokenizer required for text generation. This parameter follows the naming conventions and specifications of the transformers library for model, tokenizer, and generate kwargs. This class is responsible for algorithm allocation. In its .load() method, it precisely locates the corresponding algorithm class using algorithm_name and accesses its configuration222For each watermarking algorithm, all user-modifiable parameters are consolidated into a dedicated configuration file, facilitating easy modifications. for initialization via config_path. The method returns a fully configured algorithm object, thereby facilitating easy loading and efficient switching between different algorithms.\nWatermark. Each watermarking algorithm has its own class, collectively referred to as the Watermark class. This class includes three data members: config, utils, and logits_processor (only for algorithms in the KGW Family). config holds algorithm parameters that are loaded from a configuration file, while utils comprises various helper functions and variables essential for algorithm operations. For algorithms within the KGW Family, logits_processor is specifically designed to manipulate logits and is integrated into model.generate() for processing during execution.\nTop-level Interfaces. As illustrated in Figure 2  ###reference_###, each algorithm has four top-level interfaces for generating watermarked text, generating unwatermarked text, detecting watermarks, and obtaining data for visualization (detailed in Section 3.2  ###reference_###). Examples of invoking the watermarking algorithms are provided in Appendix C.1  ###reference_###. Due to the framework\u2019s distributive design using an AutoWatermark class to allocate and return specific algorithm objects, developers can easily add interfaces to any algorithm class without impacting others.

Algorithms within Christ family involves guiding each token selection via a pseudo-random sequence and detect watermark by correlating the sequence with the textual content. To visualize this mechanism, we use a color gradient to express the correlation value, wherein darker shades signify stronger alignment. To quantify alignment for individual tokens, we utilize the formula , as elaborated in Section 2.1  ###reference_###.

            "text": "Evaluating a LLM watermarking algorithm is a complex undertaking. Firstly, as mentioned in Section 2.2  ###reference_###, evaluating an algorithm entails considering various perspectives, including watermark detectability, robustness against tampering, and impact on text quality. Secondly, evaluations from each perspective may necessitate different metrics, attack scenarios, and tasks. Additionally, conducting an evaluation typically entails multiple steps, such as model and dataset selection, watermarked text generation, post-processing, watermark detection, text tampering, and metric computation.\nTo facilitate convenient and thorough evaluation of LLM watermarking algorithms, MarkLLM offers twelve user-friendly tools, including various metric calculators and attackers that cover the three aforementioned evaluation perspectives. Additionally, MarkLLM provides two types of automated demo pipelines, whose modules can be customized and assembled flexibly, allowing for easy configuration and use.\nEvaluation Tools. Table 1  ###reference_### summarizes all the tools currently supported in MarkLLM.\nFor the aspect of detectability, most watermarking algorithms ultimately require specifying a threshold to distinguish between watermarked and non-watermarked texts. We provide a basic success rate calculator using a fixed threshold. Additionally, to minimize the impact of threshold selection on detectability, we also offer a calculator that supports dynamic threshold selection. This tool can determine the threshold that yields the best F1 score or select a threshold based on a user-specified target false positive rate (FPR).\nFor the aspect of robustness, MarkLLM offers three word-level text tampering attacks: random word deletion at a specified ratio, random synonym substitution using WordNet (Miller, 1995  ###reference_b23###) as the synonym set, and context-aware synonym substitution utilizing BERT (Devlin et al., 2018  ###reference_b6###) as the embedding model. Additionally, two document-level text tampering attacks are provided: paraphrasing the context via OpenAI API or the Dipper model (Krishna et al., 2023  ###reference_b14###).\nFor the aspect of text quality, MarkLLM offers two direct analysis tools: a perplexity calculator to gauge fluency and a diversity calculator to evaluate the variability of texts. To analyze the impact of watermarking on text utility in specific downstream tasks, we provide a BLEU calculator for machine translation tasks and a pass-or-not judger for code generation tasks. Additionally, given the current methods for comparing the quality of watermarked and unwatermarked text, which include using a stronger LLM for judgment (Tu et al., 2023  ###reference_b32###), we also offer a GPT discriminator, utilizing GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b25###) to compare text quality.\nEvaluation Pipelines. To facilitate automated evaluation of LLM watermarking algorithms, MarkLLM provides two evaluation pipelines: one for assessing watermark detectability with and without attacks, and another for analyzing the impact of these algorithms on text quality.\n###figure_4### The upper part of Figure 4  ###reference_### illustrates the standardized process of watermark detection. Following this process, we have implemented two pipelines: WMDetect333Short for \u2018Watermarked Text Detection Pipeline\u2019. and UWMDetect444Short for \u2018Unwatermarked Text Detection Pipeline\u2019.. The primary difference between them lies in the text generation phase. The former requires the use of the generate_watermarked_text method from the watermarking algorithm, while the latter depends on the text_source parameter to determine whether to directly retrieve natural text from a dataset or to invoke the generate_unwatermarked_text method.\nThe lower part of Figure 4  ###reference_### illustrates the unified process of text quality analysis. To evaluate the impact of watermarking on text quality, pairs of watermarked and unwatermarked texts are generated. The texts, along with other necessary inputs, are then processed and fed into a designated text quality analyzer to produce detailed analysis and comparison results. Following this process, we have implemented three pipelines for different evaluation scenarios.\nDirectQual.555Short for \u2018Direct Text Quality Analysis Pipeline\u2019. This pipeline is specifically designed to analyze the quality of texts by directly comparing the characteristics of watermarked texts with those of unwatermarked texts. It evaluates metrics such as perplexity (PPL) and log diversity, without the need for any external reference texts.\nRefQual.666Short for \u2018Referenced Text Quality Analysis Pipeline\u2019. This pipeline evaluates text quality by comparing both watermarked and unwatermarked texts with a common reference text. It measures the degree of similarity or deviation from the reference text. It is ideal for scenarios that require specific downstream tasks to assess text quality, such as machine translation and code generation.\nExDisQual.777Short for \u2018External Discriminator Text Quality Analysis Pipeline\u2019. This pipeline employs an external judger, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b25###), to assess the quality of both watermarked and unwatermarked texts. The discriminator evaluates the texts based on user-provided task descriptions, identifying any potential degradation or preservation of quality due to watermarking. This method is particularly valuable when an advanced, AI-based analysis of the subtle effects of watermarking is required.\nFor complete code examples of all the pipelines mentioned above, please refer to Appendix C.3  ###reference_###."

Nonetheless, the powerful capabilities of LLMs also bring challenges, including impersonation, academic paper ghostwriting, and the spread of fake news. These issues underscore the necessity for reliable methods to distinguish human-generated content from LLM-generated content to maintain authenticity in digital communication and curb misinformation. LLM watermarking emerges as a potential solution by embedding unique features in text generated by LLMs, allowing for identification through specialized detectors.\n\n### Research Problem:\nAlthough LLM watermarking technology shows promise, the field lacks consensus and widespread support, both academically and publicly. The existing plethora of watermarking algorithms, their complex mechanisms, and diverse evaluation methods make it cumbersome for researchers and laypeople to experiment with, understand, and assess these algorithms. Therefore, a significant gap exists in providing a streamlined, comprehensible, and evaluative framework for LLM watermarking technologies.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **LLM Proficiency**: The significant strides made by models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) have brought to light both their capabilities and associated issues.\n2. **Challenges Posed by LLMs**: Literature has identified key issues such as impersonation (Salewski et al., 2023), academic paper ghostwriting (Vasilatos et al., 2023), and fake news proliferation (Meg\u00edas et al., 2021), which underline the importance of differentiating between human and machine-generated content.\n3. **LLM Watermarking Solutions**: The development of LLM watermarking algorithms like those by Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a) and Christ et al. (2023) has shown potential in creating identifiable markers within LLM-generated text, though their implementation and evaluation remain complex.\n\nMarkLLM introduces an open-source toolkit to address these needs, offering an implementation framework, visualization tools, and evaluation modules that simplify experimenting with and understanding different watermarking algorithms, thereby facilitating broader adoption and further research within the community.",
