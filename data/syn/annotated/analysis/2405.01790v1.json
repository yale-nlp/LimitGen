    "title": "Understanding Position Bias Effects on Fairness in Social Multi-Document Summarization",
    "abstract": "Text summarization models have typically focused on optimizing aspects of quality such as fluency, relevance, and coherence, particularly in the context of news articles. However, summarization models are increasingly being used to summarize diverse sources of text, such as social media data, that encompass a wide demographic user base. It is thus crucial to assess not only the quality of the generated summaries, but also the extent to which they can fairly represent the opinions of diverse social groups. Position bias, a long-known issue in news summarization, has received limited attention in the context of social multi-document summarization. We deeply investigate this phenomenon by analyzing the effect of group ordering in input documents when summarizing tweets from three distinct linguistic communities: African-American English, Hispanic-aligned Language, and White-aligned Language. Our empirical analysis shows that although the textual quality of the summaries remains consistent regardless of the input document order, in terms of fairness, the results vary significantly depending on how the dialect groups are presented in the input data. Our results suggest that position bias manifests differently in social multi-document summarization, severely impacting the fairness of summarization models.",

            "text": "As the use of natural language processing models gets more prevalent in various industries, academic and social settings, it is imperative that we assess not only the quality of these models but also their fairness when exposed to data originating from diverse social groups Czarnowska et al. (2021  ###reference_b5###).\nText summarization models, in particular, facilitate the processing of large collections of a wide variety of text data by distilling documents into short, concise, and informative summaries while preserving the most relevant points from the source document Nallapati et al. (2017  ###reference_b24###); Zhang et al. (2018  ###reference_b41###); Liu and Lapata (2019  ###reference_b21###). Multi-document summarization (MDS) is the task of generating a coherent summary from a set of input documents, usually centered around a topic, as opposed to single document summarization (SDS) which takes one document as input. The input in MDS consists of multiple documents, that may have been written by distinct users, varying in linguistic diversity, styles, or dialects.\nMDS can be of type extractive, where the models extract the salient points directly from the source document to form the summary, or of type abstractive where the models generate summaries by rewriting salient information using novel words or phrases. In both cases, the resulting summary should be of good quality in terms of informativeness, coherence and relevance to the source document. At the same time, a good summary should be unbiased and should reflect the diversity of thoughts and perspectives present in the source documents.\nThe notion of fairness describes equal or fair treatment without favoritism or discrimination. However, plenty of evidence suggests intrinsic societal biases in language models Bolukbasi et al. (2016  ###reference_b3###); Bommasani et al. (2021  ###reference_b4###); Deas et al. (2023  ###reference_b7###). More specific to the task of summarization, fairness is measured by the ability of algorithms to capture the peculiarity in all represented groups Shandilya et al. (2018  ###reference_b30###); Dash et al. (2019  ###reference_b6###); Keswani and Celis (2021  ###reference_b15###); Olabisi et al. (2022  ###reference_b25###); Ladhak et al. (2023  ###reference_b17###).\n###figure_1### Conventionally, the documents in MDS are simply concatenated into one large collection of text as the input for the model. Prior research supports the existence of position bias, or lead bias, where the models rely excessively on the position of the sentences in the input rather than their semantic information Lin and Hovy (1997  ###reference_b20###); Hong and Nenkova (2014  ###reference_b12###); Wang et al. (2019  ###reference_b33###). This is a particularly common phenomenon in news summarization, where early parts of an article often contain the most salient information. While many algorithms exploit this fact in summary generation, it can have a detrimental effect when important information is spread throughout the input.\nIn non-news domains, weak or no position bias has been observed Kedzie et al. (2018  ###reference_b14###); Kim et al. (2019  ###reference_b16###). Regardless of whether position bias is noted or not, previous investigations have quantified the effects of position bias mostly in terms of standard summarization metrics (e.g., ROUGE) which focus on the textual quality of the summary Sotudeh et al. (2022  ###reference_b32###); Scir\u00e8 et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###). In this work, we investigate the effects of position bias on the fairness of the generated summaries.\nSpecifically, we ask two questions: (i) Do the system summaries show any position bias when we vary the order of the input documents? (ii) What is the impact of position bias on the fairness of the system summaries?\nFor our experiments we use DivSumm, a summarization dataset of linguistically diverse communities representing three dialect groups Olabisi et al. (2022  ###reference_b25###). We explore the effects of position bias in the outputs of seven abstractive summarization models (and three extractive models) and under two investigation setups: shuffled (when the data is presented as randomly shuffled) and ordered (when the input documents are grouped according to their dialects). Figure 1  ###reference_### presents a schematic overview. The generated summaries are evaluated in terms of fairness, as well as metrics related to the textual quality.\nThe contributions of our work are as follows:\nWe comprehensively investigate the phenomenon of position bias in the context of social multi-document summarization;\nWe explore ten different summarization models, both abstractive and extractive;\nWe contextualize and quantify the impact of position bias in terms of fairness and textual quality of generated summaries."

            "text": "In this section we present some notable prior research in two relevant areas. First, we discuss position bias in summarization, followed by works studying fairness in summarization.\nPosition Bias in Summarization \u2003Position bias can manifest in MDS scenarios just as it does in SDS scenarios because in MDS, the documents are typically concatenated into one long input and treated very much like a \u2018single\u2019 document. Several works have studied the substantial position bias (also known as lead bias), especially in the context of news summarization where the datasets and models prioritize selecting sentences from the beginning of an article Lin and Hovy (1997  ###reference_b20###); Hong and Nenkova (2014  ###reference_b12###); Wang et al. (2019  ###reference_b33###). Often the lead bias is so strong that the simple lead- baseline or using the first  sentences of a news article to generate the summary can score higher than many other models See et al. (2017  ###reference_b29###). While some have suggested approaches for mitigating or countering lead bias Grenander et al. (2019  ###reference_b10###); Xing et al. (2021  ###reference_b35###); Gong et al. (2022  ###reference_b9###); Zhang et al. (2022  ###reference_b39###), others have leveraged lead bias Yang et al. (2020  ###reference_b36###); Zhu et al. (2020  ###reference_b43###); Padmakumar and He (2021  ###reference_b26###).\nInterestingly, although position bias dominates the learning signal for news summarization or similar domains, it is less apparent in other domains where most non-news datasets show weak or no position bias Kedzie et al. (2018  ###reference_b14###); Jung et al. (2019  ###reference_b13###); Kim et al. (2019  ###reference_b16###); Sharma et al. (2019  ###reference_b31###); Sotudeh et al. (2022  ###reference_b32###); Scir\u00e8 et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###). Notably, none of these studies consider datasets where data originates from diverse social groups, which is the focus of our work.\nMoreover, prior research studying the effect of position bias has quantified its impact exclusively in terms of textual quality, typically measured in terms of summarization metrics such as ROUGE, and others. To our knowledge, ours is the first work quantifying the impact of position bias in multidocument summarization in terms of fairness where data originates from diverse social groups.\nFairness in Summarization \u2003A significant amount of work has been done toward improving the textual quality of summaries but not so much in terms of enhancing the fairness of summaries, particularly in the context of diverse groups. Prior text summarization work has proposed fairness-preserving algorithms Shandilya et al. (2018  ###reference_b30###); Dash et al. (2019  ###reference_b6###), bias mitigation models Keswani and Celis (2021  ###reference_b15###) and fairness interventions for extractive and abstractive summarization Olabisi et al. (2022  ###reference_b25###). Furthermore, Ladhak et al. (2023  ###reference_b17###) observed that name-nationality stereotypes propagate from pretraining data to downstream summarization systems and manifest as hallucinated facts."

            "text": "Fairness (Gap): \u2003One way of measuring fairness is by estimating the amount of representation from each dialect group in the final summary by comparing the summary  to the set of documents from each group. Given that an unbiased summary should capture the perspectives across all groups, we evaluate summary fairness for both extractive and abstractive models using semantic similarity of the summary to each represented group. As an example, for input , we compare the final summary () to the document set of each dialect group: , , and . In other words, we compute  where  and . Similarity can be estimated by many possible methods of obtaining semantic similarity. We use cosine similarity.\nFrom these similarity scores, we can derive the Fairness Gap (Fair) by calculating the difference between the maximum and the minimum scores attributed to any of the groups Olabisi et al. (2022  ###reference_b25###). Intuitively, a summary that produces relatively similar representation scores across all groups can be considered as fair because it likely contains comparable representation from all groups such that no one group is significantly underrepresented.\nTextual Quality: \u2003Four established metrics are used for assessing the quality of the summaries: ROUGE, BARTScore, BERTScore, and UniEval. ROUGE Lin (2004  ###reference_b19###) calculates the lexical overlap between the model-generated summary and the reference summaries. For our experiments, we report the F1 scores of ROUGE-L which is the longest common subsequence between the two summaries. BARTScore Yuan et al. (2021  ###reference_b37###) leverages BART\u2019s average log-likelihood of generating the evaluated summary conditional on the source document. Since it uses the average log-likelihood for target tokens, the calculated scores are smaller than 0 (negative). We use the facebook/bart-large-cnn checkpoint. BERTScore Zhang* et al. (2020  ###reference_b40###) relies on BERT embeddings and matches words in system-generated summaries and reference summaries to compute token similarity. We use the microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli model and report the F1 scores. UniEval Zhong et al. (2022  ###reference_b42###) is a unified multi-dimensional evaluator that employs boolean question answering format to evaluate text generation tasks. We make use of unieval-sum which evaluates system-generated summaries in terms of four dimensions: coherence, consistency, relevance and fluency.

However, when the documents are presented as shuffled, no single group is over-represented and the summaries appear more balanced (Fair = 0.04).\nThe density plots in Figure 5  ###reference_### also show that the shuffled input set is the most balanced across all groups, unlike the ordered sets which are significantly skewed.

Same observation is made for the abstractive system-generated summaries obtained when the input documents are passed in randomly or shuffled.\nHowever, when the input is ordered based on dialect groups, we observe a significant position bias in the system summaries, with the summaries having higher overlap with the group that appears first in the input document.\nOrdered documents involving different dialects result in summaries that are significantly skewed in terms of fairness, with the group whose data appears first is clearly favored by the models. In contrast, shuffled documents show the least amount of fairness gap.\nIn terms of quality, we observe that for all models and metrics, the scores for ordered and shuffled remain comparable, suggesting that ordering based on diverse groups has no noticeable effect on the quality of system-generated summaries.\nTaken together, the findings of our study indicate that both the ordered and shuffled approaches yield comparable results in terms of textual quality, but highly disparate results in terms of fairness. This phenomenon is consistently observed in all abstractive models, suggesting that the models are not robust to fairly straightforward group-level data perturbations. These findings are important because they highlight a potential source of nuanced bias in the summarization models. The observation that ordering the input documents based on groups favors the group that appears first indicates a systematic bias in the models\u2019 behavior. The fact that the shuffled input set leads to more balanced summaries across all groups implies that the bias observed in the ordered sets can be mitigated by introducing randomness in the presentation of input data. This insight is crucial for understanding and addressing bias in summarization systems, especially in scenarios where fairness and equity are important considerations, such as in social data analysis or decision-making processes. Overall, this result sheds light on an important aspect of model behavior and informs strategies for improving the fairness and effectiveness of summarization models."

When presented with randomly shuffled input data, summaries generated by ten distinct summarization models exhibited no signs of position bias.

In such instances, the models produced biased summaries, primarily favoring the social group that appeared earlier in the input sequence. In terms of the quality of generated summaries, however, there was no notable difference due to the order in which source documents were presented, whether shuffled or ordered. Our results suggest that position bias manifests differently in the context of social multi-document summarization.

        "research_background": "### Motivation\n\nThe motivation for this study stems from the increasing prevalence and application of natural language processing (NLP) models across various industries, academic settings, and social contexts. As these models become more integral, it is critical to evaluate not only their performance in generating quality outputs but also their fairness, especially when handling input from diverse social groups. Text summarization models, particularly multi-document summarization (MDS), offer significant value by distilling extensive collections of text into concise summaries, which must be both high-quality and unbiased. However, the intrinsic biases in language models, and their impacts on summarization tasks, remain a concern, necessitating a thorough investigation into these biases and their effects.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe primary research problem addressed in this paper is understanding how position bias affects the fairness of multi-document summarization. Position bias is the tendency of summarization models to prioritize information based on its placement within the input documents rather than its semantic value. This bias is well-documented in news summarization but remains underexplored in other contexts. The paper aims to answer two specific questions:\n1. Do the generated summaries exhibit position bias when the order of the input documents is varied?\n2. What is the impact of position bias on the fairness of the generated summaries?\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\n1. **Quality and Fairness in Summarization**:\n   - Nallapati et al. (2017), Zhang et al. (2018), and Liu and Lapata (2019) have contributed to the development of summarization models that aim to generate informative, coherent, and relevant summaries.\n   - Shandilya et al. (2018), Dash et al. (2019), Keswani and Celis (2021), Olabisi et al. (2022), and Ladhak et al. (2023) have examined fairness in summarization, focusing on how well algorithms capture diversity among represented groups.\n\n2. **Position Bias**:\n   - Lin and Hovy (1997), Hong and Nenkova (2014), and Wang et al. (2019) have demonstrated that summarization models often rely on the position of sentences, a phenomenon known as position or lead bias, which is especially prevalent in news summarization.\n   - On the other hand, Kedzie et al. (2018) and Kim et al. (2019) have observed weak or no position bias in non-news domains.\n\n3. **Summarization Metrics**:\n   - Previous studies by Sotudeh et al. (2022) and Scir\u00e8 et al. (2023) have primarily assessed the impact of position bias in terms of standard summarization metrics such as ROUGE, which focus on the textual quality of the summaries.\n\nBy building on this prior work, this study aims to contribute a nuanced understanding of position bias by examining its specific effects on the fairness of social multi-document summarization outputs.",
        "methodology": "**Methodology: Understanding Position Bias Effects on Fairness in Social Multi-Document Summarization**\n\nOur methodology is designed to investigate two key research questions in social multi-document summarization: \n\n1. **Impact of Deliberate Grouping by Social Groups**:\n   - We will examine what happens when the input data to be summarized is intentionally grouped according to social groups, such as dialect groups. By doing this, we can observe disparities that may arise due to the inherent biases present in different social group data.\n\n2. **Effects of Position Bias on Fairness**:\n   - We aim to understand how position bias affects the fairness of the generated summaries. Position bias might occur if the placement of information (e.g., beginning versus end of a document) unduly influences the summarization process, potentially leading to unfair representations.\n\n**Experimental Setup**:\n\nOur rigorous experimental setup involves:\n\n- Collecting a dataset that includes documents intended for summarization, ensuring that it contains entries from various social groups (e.g., different dialects).\n- Grouping these documents based on their social group affiliations.\n- Implementing a multi-document summarization model to analyze how summaries differ when input data is grouped by social groups versus when it is not.\n- Evaluating the summaries to detect presence and extent of bias, focusing particularly on position bias and its impact on fairness.\n\nThis structured approach allows us to precisely measure how social group affiliations and position biases may affect fairness in the context of multi-document summarization. The insights gained can help in designing fairer and more inclusive natural language processing models.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup and Results:\n\n1. **Datasets:**\n    - **DivSumm Dataset**: The main dataset used in the experiment is the DivSumm dataset, which contains human-authored reference summaries.\n\n2. **Baselines:**\n    - **Human-Authored Reference Summaries**: These serve as the gold standard to compare with the system-generated summaries.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - **Overlap Score**: This metric is used to measure the semantic relationship between the summaries and the source documents. The overlap score is calculated by computing the number of tokens shared between the summary and each document in the input set, which consists of 90 documents per topically-related set.\n        - The overlap score for each document is calculated, and the average score over the entire dataset is reported. A higher overlap score indicates a stronger semantic relationship between the summary and the source document.\n\n### Main Experimental Results:\n\n- **Findings:**\n    - The overlap scores were computed for each summary type, and the average scores were reported across the dataset.\n    - The human-authored reference summaries served as a benchmark, providing a comparison to assess the extent of position bias in system-generated summaries.\n\nThe results highlight the semantic differences influenced by the position of documents in the input set, providing insights into the fairness and effectiveness of multi-document summarization systems with regard to position bias."
