            "text": "The integration of conversational AI technologies, specifically ChatGPT OpenAI (2023  ###reference_b12###), into the field of artificial intelligence signifies a significant advancement. In the realm of artificial intelligence and language models, the concept of \"alignment\" is considered essential Askell et al. (2021  ###reference_b1###). This concept focuses on ensuring that AI systems operate in a manner that aligns with human intentions and expectations Christiano et al. (2017  ###reference_b6###). The RLHF approach is a prominent method in this context and consists of two main phases. Initially, it utilizes preference data collected from a diverse range of crowdsource workers to train a reward model Ouyang et al. (2022  ###reference_b13###). Subsequently, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are employed to improve the performance of the language model, aiming to maximize the rewards obtained. The reward model plays a crucial role in the RLHF process, aiming to accurately reflect human preferences.\nNevertheless, the process of using RLHF to develop a language model that is well-aligned presents challenges, especially when it comes to optimizing the reward model Casper et al. (2023  ###reference_b5###). A phenomenon referred to as \"reward hacking\" or \"reward over-optimization\" arises Gao et al. (2023  ###reference_b9###); Skalse et al. (2022  ###reference_b19###), where the language model cleverly identifies and takes advantage of weaknesses in the reward model in order to maximize rewards. This exploitation occurs because the reward model is based on static human preference data, while the language model\u2019s input distribution dynamically evolves during the alignment process.\nOur study highlights two significant challenges in reward modeling. Firstly, the model\u2019s limited generalizability becomes apparent when applied to out-of-distribution examples, exacerbated by policy drift during the reinforcement learning process, leading to changes in the prediction distribution that challenge the model\u2019s accuracy Zhuang and Hadfield-Menell (2020  ###reference_b24###). Secondly, the presence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset, attributed to low inter-annotator agreement (72.6% for InstructGPT) Ouyang et al. (2022  ###reference_b13###), undermines the model\u2019s performance. This variability in labeling accuracy introduces uncertainty and potential biases, complicating the model\u2019s ability to discern correct responses based on human preferences Bowman et al. (2022  ###reference_b3###).\nOur research has found that existing reward models, when trained using the traditional ranking objective based on human preference data, often struggle to effectively distinguish between responses that are more or less favorable in real-world scenarios. We argue that this issue is the main reason why the reward model has limited success in accurately capturing genuine human preferences. The standard ranking objective, which aims to order responses based on human preferences, does not inherently guarantee a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies and complexities present in real-world situations. Although the model is trained to determine which response is more preferable than another, it lacks a quantitative framework to measure the degree of superiority of one response over another.\nTo address this shortcoming, we propose incorporating a margin score into the training process of the reward model. The margin score is a numerical value that quantifies the extent of differences between various generations, specifically in terms of their alignment with human preferences Touvron et al. (2023  ###reference_b21###). By integrating this margin score, we aim to explicitly teach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to generations that diverge significantly from one another, thereby enhancing its ability to recognize and prioritize more preferable responses. The margin score helps in mitigating the effects of noisy data. By focusing on the discrepancies in responses, the model is better equipped to filter out inconsistencies arising from ambiguous or incorrect preferences in the training dataset. Furthermore, the margin score introduces a new dimension to the RLHF process. Instead of solely optimizing for the top-ranked response, the language model is encouraged to generate responses that not only align with human preferences but also demonstrate a clear distinction in quality and relevance when compared to lower-ranked alternatives. This approach promotes a more robust and reliable model, one that is less susceptible to being misled by closely ranked but potentially misleading responses.\nIn the real practice of human preference modeling, accurately determining the difference in preference between different responses is a difficult task that requires significant effort and time cost. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel method based on reward confidence to estimate the preference differences without the need for detailed, exhaustive labels from human annotators. This approach capitalizes on the inherent knowledge embedded within the model, utilizing reward confidence level as a means to explore the subtle nuances of preference differences.\nIn section 4  ###reference_###, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the reward margin distribution in models of different sizes and accuracies to support our hypotheses. Additionally, we utilize GPT-4 as an automatic annotator to examine the impact of reward margin on downstream tasks. This involves annotating the actual margin values between selected and non-selected responses and training a reward model using these margin values. Our experimental results provide empirical evidence that incorporating margin values into the training process significantly improves the effectiveness of reward models. In Section 5  ###reference_###, we present a novel methodology for training reward models based on the concept of reward confidence. Subsequently, in section 6.2  ###reference_###, we perform a series of experiments on various datasets that reflect human preferences to validate our approach. We not only evaluate the reward accuracy but also compare the win rate of the enhanced reward model against a baseline model in different settings. This comparative analysis not only demonstrates the superiority of our approach in terms of reward prediction accuracy but also highlights its effectiveness in practical applications."

These large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks across mathematics, programming, and tool use, supported by a three-step training process: pre-training on token prediction, supervised fine-tuning to follow instructions, and reinforcement learning to optimize for desired behaviors. However, developing appropriate rewards for RL, particularly within the RLHF framework, is challenging. The effectiveness of RL in improving LLMs hinges on the quality of reward models trained to mimic human evaluative patterns. Wang et al. (2024  ###reference_b22###) also discuss how data featuring varying strengths of preference differently influence the performance of reward models. However, their analysis primarily addresses data characterized by incorrect, ambiguous, and normal preferences, in contrast to our study which concentrates on the preference margin within the reward model itself, making it applicable across various data types."

            "text": "In RLHF, reward hacking poses a significant challenge by causing misalignment between reward model optimization and actual human preferences. Initially, optimization may improve performance, but as training progresses, the model may exploit RM vulnerabilities to gain higher rewards without meeting intended criteria. This leads to outputs that are either linguistically poor or overly verbose and misaligned with human preferences. It also complicates checkpoint selection, echoing Goodhart\u2019s Law that a measure loses its value as a target Gao et al. (2023  ###reference_b9###).\nMultiple approaches have been proposed to mitigate reward hacking in RLHF.\nShen et al. (2023  ###reference_b18###) proposed to use a smaller reward model to learn the biases in the reward and a larger reward model to learn the true reward.\nRewarded Soup (Rame et al., 2023  ###reference_b15###) interpolates weights of policies trained to optimize different reward objectives, which can approximate more costly multi-policy strategies.\nEisenstein et al. (2023  ###reference_b7###) found that reward model ensembles can mitigate reward hackings, but not eliminating them.\nDifferent from these approaches, we focus on the learning objective of reward model to ensure it accurately reflects human values and preferences."

This approach is primarily segmented into three distinct phases: supervised fine-Tuning, preference sampling coupled with reward model training, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning utilizing proximal policy optimization (PPO) Schulman et al. (2017  ###reference_b17###). The journey commences with a baseline pre-trained language model, which is subsequently subjected to supervised training on a meticulously curated dataset tailored for specific downstream applications. This phase culminates in the creation of a model, symbolized as . Our study predominantly concentrates on enhancing the latter two stages of this pipeline.\nThe RLHF process starts with a pre-trained LM, which is then fine-tuned using a high-quality dataset for downstream tasks like dialogue and summarization, resulting in the refined model .\nIn the subsequent stage, the SFT model is engaged to respond to a user\u2019s query, represented by . This interaction generates two distinct responses, . Human evaluators are then tasked with selecting their preferred response, leading to a preference notation , where  and  symbolize the chosen and rejected responses, respectively. Employing the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952  ###reference_b4###), we establish a preference distribution, anchored by the reward function , as elucidated in the following equation:\nwhere  denotes the logistic function. This setup is analogous to a binary classification task, leading to the formulation of a negative log-likelihood loss function, as depicted in Equation:\nHere, the dataset  comprises a series of comparative pairings , , . Within the context of language models, the reward network  is typically initialized using the SFT model  and further refined by integrating an additional linear layer atop the final transformer layer.

            "text": "This study focuses on the reward model\u2019s role in assessing the quality of model-generated responses and their corresponding prompts. The reward model assigns scores to indicate the response quality, which are pivotal for fine-tuning the policy model during RLHF. This process is instrumental in aligning the model more closely with human preferences, thereby augmenting its utility and safety. For the training phase of the reward model, our approach converts the accumulated human preference data into binary labels, namely \u2019chosen\u2019 and \u2019rejected\u2019. We adhere to the principle that scores for preferred responses must exceed those for their counterparts, as detailed in Equation 2  ###reference_###. This approach enables us to quantify the preference discrepancy between chosen and rejected using the formula .\nIn Fig.LABEL:fig:margin, we examine the impact of various model configurations on the distribution of reward margins. The accuracy of each model, as detailed in this investigation, is presented in Table 1  ###reference_###. Our findings confirm that the average reward margin for these models consistently remains above zero. This aligns with the theoretical expectation that positive rewards should outweigh negative ones and suggests that the model effectively distinguishes between different responses. A higher mean value correlates with the model\u2019s enhanced capability in distinguishing various responses. However, a notable number of instances exhibit reward margins below zero, potentially due to dataset noise or anomalies, as discussed in the preceding section.\nRegarding the skewness metric, all model distributions exhibit a value exceeding zero, indicating a rightward skew. This skewness, particularly pronounced on the right side, implies a more sophisticated performance level of the model, underlining its improved ability to differentiate and allocate varied rewards. Furthermore, models that demonstrate higher efficacy exhibit lower kurtosis, suggesting a more even and broad distribution. This observation implies that the reward distribution should not be overly centralized around a specific mean, such as zero. Rather, it should exhibit a range of variability across different data pairings, each with unique margin values. This aspect, along with the noted skewness, is critical for ensuring a refined and precise differentiation among the outcomes linked to diverse data pairs. It underscores the importance of the reward model in assigning markedly different scores to generations with varying characteristics."

            "text": "In the domain of human preference modeling, accurately determining the difference in preference between different responses is a difficult task that requires significant effort and time cost. Traditional methods, commonly used in popular datasets like HH Bai et al. (2022  ###reference_b2###) and SHP Ethayarajh et al. (2022  ###reference_b8###), have typically used a simple approach where human annotators are asked to choose the preferred option from a pair. While this binary labeling technique is efficient, it fails to capture the nuanced range of preference differences that could offer deeper insights into the modeling of human preferences.\nTo bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel method based on local approximation of reward confidence to estimate the preference differences without the need for detailed, exhaustive labels from human annotators. Therefore, this approach ultimately aims to align with the goal of Figure LABEL:fig:margin, which is to have a larger margin mean to ensure that the quality of preference can be identified. At the same time, the overall distribution shifts to the right to reduce the impact of noise and to differentiate preference with greater granularity.\nTo achieve the first point, we construct our approach based on the idea of Equation 3  ###reference_###. We have transformed Equation 3  ###reference_### into the following mathematical form.\nIt calculates the Loss of each batch  with its samples , and  is the mean margin of the batch:\nThese Equations that use batch margin have two advantages: (1) increasing the model\u2019s prediction of differences between preferences; (2) ensuring computational efficiency and enabling real-time updates.\nTo achieve the second point of the right-skewed nature of the overall distribution, and further reduce the changes of the Equation 2  ###reference_### to maintain theoretical guarantees, we design a simple threshold filtering method so that only a subset of samples adopt Equation 4  ###reference_### for loss calculation, shown in Equation 6  ###reference_###.\nwhere\nAs a filtering function,  is used to verify the status of the margin of the samples . With Equation 6  ###reference_###, it increases the margin of samples whose current margin is smaller than the average margin of the batch by adding a constraint of the average margin to the loss function, thereby shifting the overall margin to the right. In addition, it maintains the original loss function for samples with a current margin larger than the average margin of the batch to preserve their original properties."

We begin by providing a detailed explanation of our experimental framework in Section 6.1  ###reference_###. Then, in Section 6.2  ###reference_###, we discuss the substantial enhancements our approach brings compared to traditional RM training methods. After that, we delve into the examination of the reward distribution generated by the RMs, demonstrating the influence of employing a diverse preference dataset on reward modeling.\nIn the course of our investigation, we utilized diverse human preference datasets to evaluate the efficacy of our approach in training reward models. These datasets included the Anthropic\u2019s Helpful and Harmless dataset (referred to as HH) Bai et al. (2022  ###reference_b2###), the OpenAssistant multi-lingual conversations dataset (OASST1) K\u00f6pf et al. (2023  ###reference_b10###), the WebGPT comparisons dataset (WebGPT) Nakano et al.

The WebGPT and chatbot dataset was partitioned into 90% instances for training purposes and 10% instances for evaluation.\nTo accommodate various experimental scenarios, we deployed language models (LMs) of differing capacities for the training of reward models, including Pythia-410m, TinyLlama-1.1B-chat 222https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0  ###reference_-1.1B-Chat-v1.0###, Pythia-1.4B, Pythia-2.8B, and Llama-7B-chat. We employed the last token embedding from the output hidden states as the pooled hidden representation. Subsequently, a linear layer, referred to as the RM head, with a scale-value output, was integrated to forecast reward scores. we set the batch size for all RM training at 128. The maximum permissible input sequence length was set at 2048 tokens. All reward models underwent fine-tuning for a single epoch, utilizing the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 9e-6.\nThe foundation of our evaluation is the accuracy metric, detailed in section 6.1  ###reference_###, which directly reflects the models\u2019 ability to predict rewards aligning with human judgments across datasets. This allows for a quantitative comparison of reward prediction precision among models of varying sizes.\nAs illustrated in Table 2  ###reference_###, which presents the performance scores of different models on various preference benchmarks, the application of our method consistently enhances the accuracy across all models and benchmarks. Notably, Pythia-410M with our method outperforms its baseline by a significant margin, demonstrating a 6.31% increase in the HH benchmark and a 2.48% rise in the OASST1 benchmark. Similarly, the Pythia-2.8B model with our method shows improved accuracy, with a notable increase of 1.93% in the OASST1 benchmark and 2.10% in OASST1 benchmark.

This reinforces the notion that incorporating better ability of pre-trained model can significantly elevate the performance of reward model.\nThese results collectively suggest that our method not only improves accuracy in a consistent manner but also scales effectively with model size, validating the robustness and efficiency of our approach in aligning model predictions with human preferences.\nHowever, it is also crucial to consider the role of diminishing returns as model size increases. Although the Llama-7B-chat model achieves the highest accuracy, the relative improvement over its base model is less pronounced compared to the gains observed with the Pythia-410M model.

The results, detailed in FigureLABEL:fig:bestofn, highlight the impact of the size of the reward model and the choice of N on the quality of generated responses in terms of helpfulness and harmlessness.\nFrom the FigureLABEL:fig:bestofn, we can observe some interesting results: Initially, as  increases, all models show improved win rates. This is expected since a broader selection typically leads to a better choice. Each model has a peak performance at a certain  value: =64 for Pythia-410M and =8 for Pythia-2.8B, suggesting an optimal  range that varies by model. After reaching peak performance, the win rate either plateaus or declines slightly, indicating diminishing returns with additional choices. This is particularly notable for larger models, implying a limit to the benefits of more options. The size of the reward model does not linearly correlate with the optimal  value, hinting at complex interactions between model capacity and the ability to discern quality output. The TinyLlama-1.1B model demonstrates consistent improvement, showing strong selection capabilities across a range of  values. All models perform above a 50% win rate, confirming their effectiveness in selecting high-quality outputs over baselines. In summary, the data suggests that while having more samples generally improves performance, there is an optimal number of samples for each model, beyond which the benefit plateaus or decreases. This optimal point is not directly proportional to model size and should be a focus for future optimization efforts.\nAs depicted in Figure LABEL:fig:bestofn_6.9b, a distinct trend emerges across the models, with the notable exception of the Pythia-410M model, which exhibits a pronounced upward trend. The other models also generally show an increase in win rate with the number of games played (), but the trends are not as smooth or consistent. This observation suggests that when the policy model significantly exceeds the size of the reward model, larger policy models derive diminished benefits from optimization efforts against a reward model."

            "text": "In conclusion, our study reveals the significance of the reward margin in the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback. The margin score not only serves as a critical parameter in training the reward model but also plays a pivotal role in shaping the policy model\u2019s performance. The optimal margin setting strikes a balance, ensuring that the model can effectively discern between high and low-quality responses without overly penalizing subtle variations in response quality. Compared with expensive human annotation, we explore an adaptive margin techniques that dynamically adjust the reward margin based on the reward confidence. The evaluation on reward accuracy and downstream tasks underscore the benefits of this method, contributing to a more refined and efficient model of human preference."

        "paper_title": "Towards Understanding the Influence of Reward Margin on Preference Model Performance",
        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation:\nThe motivation behind this paper arises from challenges in effectively developing language models that are well-aligned with human preferences. Specifically, it focuses on improving the robustness and reliability of reward models used in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The authors are driven to address the issues related to \"reward hacking\" or \"reward over-optimization\" and the inaccuracies caused by policy drift and ambiguities in human preference data annotations.\n\n### Research Problem:\nThe paper tackles the problem of suboptimal performance in current reward models due to their reliance on a traditional ranking objective based on human preference data. These models struggle with accurately distinguishing between responses in real-world scenarios, largely because they lack a quantitative framework to measure the degree of superiority between responses. Moreover, incorrect and ambiguous preferences within the dataset exacerbate this problem.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n\n1. **ChatGPT and RLHF**:\n   - ChatGPT signifies a major advancement in conversational AI (OpenAI, 2023 [#12]). The RLHF approach, which aligns AI systems with human intentions, incorporates reinforcement learning techniques and is essential in the development of language models (Askell et al., 2021 [#1]; Christiano et al., 2017 [#6]).\n   \n2. **Challenges in Reward Modeling**:\n   - RLHF faces significant challenges, such as optimizing the reward model and avoiding reward exploitation (Casper et al., 2023 [#5]; Gao et al., 2023 [#9]; Skalse et al., 2022 [#19]). These challenges arise because the reward model is based on static human preference data while the language model's input distribution evolves dynamically.\n\n3. **Inter-Annotator Agreement and Labeling Accuracy**:\n   - The reliability of human annotated data is compromised due to low inter-annotator agreement (72.6% in InstructGPT as per Ouyang et al., 2022 [#13]) and variability in labeling accuracy (Bowman et al., 2022 [#3]).\n\n4. **Generalizability and Policy Drift**:\n   - Reward models face issues such as limited generalizability to out-of-distribution examples and policy drift, which hampers prediction distribution accuracy (Zhuang and Hadfield-Menell, 2020 [#24]).\n  \n5. **Integration of Margin Scores**:\n   - The proposed integration of a margin score aims to address the shortcomings of current reward models. This score quantifies the differences between various generation alignments with human preferences (Touvron et al., 2023 [#21]).\n\nBy integrating a margin score and leveraging reward confidence to estimate preference differences, the authors aim to enhance the reward model's capability to identify and prioritize more preferable responses, even in the presence of noisy data. This novel methodology is tested and validated through comprehensive analyses and validates experiments on varied datasets reflecting human preferences.",
        "methodology": "The methodology presented in this study focuses on improving human preference modeling by addressing the limitations of traditional binary labeling techniques used in existing datasets. The proposed method involves:\n\n1. **Local Approximation of Reward Confidence**: The method estimates preference differences without requiring detailed labels from human annotators. This approximation aims to identify the quality of preferences with greater precision and a larger margin mean.\n\n2. **Equation Transformation and Loss Calculation**:\n    - The authors construct their approach using a redefined version of Equation 3.\n    - The transformed equation calculates the loss for each batch by factoring in the sample margins and the mean margin of the batch.\n    - This approach increases the model's ability to predict differences between preferences and ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time updates.\n\n3. **Right-Skewed Distribution and Filtering Function**:\n    - To skew the overall distribution to the right and reduce noise impact, a threshold filtering method is designed.\n    - Using Equation 6, a filtering function adjusts the loss calculation for samples with current margins smaller than the batch's average margin.\n    - The adjustment involves adding a constraint based on the average margin, enhancing granularity in preference differentiation.\n\n **Key Components and Innovations**:\n - **Novel Margin-Based Loss Function**: The innovative loss function incorporates batch margin, improving the identification of preference differences.\n - **Threshold Filtering Mechanism**: This mechanism selectively increases the margin for certain samples, thereby refining the distribution of preference data and preserving high-quality samples' original properties. \n\nIn summary, the proposed method aims to enhance preference modeling by approximating reward confidence locally, using an advanced loss function, and implementing a threshold filtering mechanism to improve granularity and computational efficiency.",
