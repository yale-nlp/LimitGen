    "abstract": "Current work in language models (LMs) helps us speed up or even skip thinking by accelerating and automating cognitive work.\nBut can LMs help us with critical thinking \u2013 thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts?\nWe treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking, and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs.\nWe find that philosophers do not find LMs to be useful because they lack a sense of selfhood (memory, beliefs, consistency) and initiative (curiosity, proactivity). We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools to characterize this gap.\nUsing the model, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent.\nWe hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other \u2018critical thinkers\u2019 to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs.",

(Minimally adapted from Huxley (2006  ###reference_b42###).)\nLanguage Models (LMs) have recently alleviated a whole host of our intellectual inconveniences.\nThey can help us do things we would have begrudgingly done by ourselves otherwise: write code (Chen et al., 2021  ###reference_b18###; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2024  ###reference_b72###), generate emails  (Goodman et al., 2022  ###reference_b33###), and translate text  (Costa-juss\u00e0 et al., 2022  ###reference_b19###).\nIn sparking ideas by generating stories (Schwitzgebel et al., 2023  ###reference_b76###) and concept designs (Ma et al., 2023  ###reference_b55###), LMs offer shortcuts to gaining new thoughts.\nThey also help us put our thinking into words by revising (Mysore et al., 2023  ###reference_b62###) and giving feedback (Liang et al., 2023  ###reference_b53###) on our writing.\nIn all these cases, LMs help us speed up and circumvent the inconveniences of thinking ourselves.\nIn many contexts, however, the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of thinking is not a temporary problem to be alleviated, but a deep puzzle to be reflected upon.\nMany people are invested in specific areas of intellectual inquiry \u2013 e.g., historians, scientists, philosophers \u2013 and more generally, in reflection and engagement with the world \u2013 e.g., as informed political citizens, critical consumers of media, and moral actors.\nThey are interested in identifying and challenging assumptions, clarifying muddled ideas, and engineering new and useful ways to think.\nCore to this sort of inquiry is critical thinking \u2013 \u201cthe propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism\u201d (McPeck, 2016  ###reference_b56###).\nCan LMs serve as tools for critical thinking \u2013 helping us think more deeply and in more complex ways, rather than faster or not at all?\nWhat if \u2013 like John \u2013 we claim all the rights to think?\nTo investigate how LMs can serve as critical thinking tools, we use philosophers as a case study \u2013 philosophers being people who are in the business of thinking critically about a wide range of concepts and ideas.\nWe interview 21 professional philosophers to understand their thinking processes, collect their experiences with and views on current LMs, and brainstorm the roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools in philosophy (\u00a73  ###reference_###).\nWe find that current philosophers do not think LMs are good critical thinking tools (\u00a74  ###reference_###) for two primary reasons: LMs are too neutral, detached, and nonjudgmental (\u00a74.2  ###reference_###); and LMs are too servile, passive, and incurious (\u00a74.3  ###reference_###).\nWe propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, which explains why philosophers find conversations with other philosophers and reading philosophical texts to be more helpful for their work than current LMs (\u00a75.1  ###reference_###).\nUsing the model, we describe three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent (\u00a75.2  ###reference_###).\nFinally, we outline how these LMs could inform metaphilosophical questions and shape the discipline of philosophy (\u00a76.1  ###reference_###), and discuss challenges in building LMs (\u00a76.2  ###reference_###) and interfaces (\u00a76.3  ###reference_###) for critical thinking."

Science requires advances not only in empirical work, but also in the underlying paradigms of research (Kuhn & Hawkins, 1963  ###reference_b50###) and navigation of a variety of social, technical, and material factors (Latour, 1989  ###reference_b51###).\nA limited body of work has explored how LMs might contribute towards human critical thinking.\nRodman (2023  ###reference_b71###) suggests that political theorists might use LMs to metacognitively reflect upon their own creative processes and judgments.\nCai et al. (2024  ###reference_b11###) consider how currently \u201csycophantic\u201d, \u201cservile\u201d, and \u201clobotimized\u201d LMs can be used in more critical ways by challenging users\u2019 pre-existing ideas and constructively using antagonistic interactions to develop their thinking.\nPark & Kulkarni (2024  ###reference_b65###) show how LMs as \u201cthinking assistants\u201d can facilitate human self-reflection by asking, instead of answering, questions."

Current LMs exhibit low selfhood (\u00a74.2  ###reference_###).\nInitiative is a resource\u2019s ability to set its own intentions and goals, possibly different from its user\u2019s, and to execute actions oriented towards those intentions.\nHigh-direction resources are not strictly or existentially bound to their user\u2019s directives, and may deviate from them.\nCurrent LMs exhibit low initiative (\u00a74.3  ###reference_###).\nThese two axes form the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, and explain why philosophers find texts and other people (but not LMs) to be useful tools.\nOur model further provides a design space for LMs as critical thinking tools.\n###figure_1### Why do philosophers find other people and texts to be useful critical thinking tools?\nIn the selfhood-initiative model, other people are high-selfhood, variable-initiative tools.\nPeople have specific backgrounds and experiences which inform their views, perspectives, and beliefs; these influence how they understand and respond.\nPhilosophers find value in talking to other people often because of their selfhood; they expect that they will receive interesting judgements and comments, rather than placid neutrality.\nHowever, these people may have variable initiative, depending on the situation.\nIn free-flowing conversation, each interlocutor may carry the conversation in some direction, whereas in a more focused conversation aimed at collecting feedback, an interlocutor may be expected to directly respond to one\u2019s ideas and requests without their own intellectual initiative.\nThe high selfhood of other people is helpful because it provides particular perspectives and ways of looking into the problem space.\nMeanwhile, in the selfhood-initiative model, texts are high-initiative, variable-selfhood tools.\nTexts are not themselves responsive to a user\u2019s intentions (Plato, 2008a  ###reference_b66###); they express the author\u2019s attempt to fulfill their intentions, and one encounters the product of this attempt after the fact of its production.\nThis exteriority from the user allows the user to reflect upon similarities and differences between their own thinking and the tool\u2019s outputs.\nOn the other hand, the way in which texts are written can vary in the degree of selfhood they express.\nInformative, survey-based, and clarificatory papers tend to de-emphasize an author\u2019s perspectives and opinions, whereas more explicitly argumentative papers may center them; both can be useful to philosophers in different ways.\nWhy don\u2019t philosophers find current LMs to be useful critical thinking tools?\nIn the selfhood-initiative model, current LMs are low-selfhood, low-initiative tools.\nThey do not provide philosophers with particular concrete perspectives into the problem space, nor do they provide ideas sufficiently exterior to a philosopher\u2019s own thinking to allow for meaningful reflection and connections.\nThese properties make LMs particularly useful for alternative modes of thought, such as carrying out rote and well-defined tasks and helping rewrite sentences, but hamper critical thinking."

            "text": "According to the selfhood-initiative model, good critical thinking tools should have high selfhood, high initiative, or both.\nFrom our model, we set out three roles of LMs for philosophy \u2013 the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent \u2013 corresponding to the three viable cells in the selfhood-initiative model (high-selfhood, high-initiative; low-selfhood, high-initiative; high-selfhood; low-initiative)\nThe Interlocutor  high-selfhood, high-initiative.\nPhilosophers mention that they often get their ideas in free-flowing conversation with fellow philosophers or from reading literature making arguments which seem tenuous, incorrect, or incomplete (\u00a74.1  ###reference_###).\nIn the terms of the selfhood-initiative model, these are high-selfhood, high-initiative tools.\nAs a role for LMs, the Interlocutor would invert many of the human-AI relationships taken for granted in current LMs.\nRather than attempting to remain neutral, the Interlocutor makes judgments and takes positions based on its perspectives.\nRather than accommodating and affirming users\u2019 every response, the Interlocutor thinks through and challenges or disagrees with what its users say; it responds or modifies its own beliefs if users make reasonable points.\nRather than remaining passive and answering user questions, the Interlocutor asks its own questions in pursuit of its \u2018own\u2019 interests, and refuses or redirects certain lines of inquiry in favor of others.\nRather than being amnesic and detached, the Interlocutor draws upon its persistent memories and beliefs across sessions to produce ideas.\nThe Interlocutor does not need to be strictly antagonistic, as explored in Cai et al. (2024  ###reference_b11###); indeed, it may be charitable and polite, much like colleagues, while at the same time resisting the \u201cservility\u201d and \u201csycophancy\u201d disrupted by the antagonistic paradigm.\nThe Monitor  low-selfhood, high-initiative.\nWhile developing ideas, philosophers consciously or unconsciously encounter various \u201cdecision junctures\u201d at which they use certain approaches or pursue certain ideas over others. (P6).\nMany philosophers suggest that it may be important to reduce, or at least become more aware of, the choices at these decision junctures (P6, P2, P7).\nWithout such awareness, philosophers may expose their ideas to imprecision (\u2018which path did you exactly take?\u2019) and objections (\u2018why this path and not others?\u2019); moreover, these choices may reproduce personal and disciplinary biases, reifying metaphilosophical problems (\u00a76.1  ###reference_###).\nAs a role for LMs, the Monitor acts as a \u201cchecks and balances\u201d on philosophizing; it is not interested in retaining self-consistency or in expressing particular points of view (low selfhood), but has high initiative to provide a variety of ideas and resources to the user.\nThe Monitor functions similarly to survey texts which provide a \u2018lay of the land\u2019, illustrating different approaches and ideas to help philosophers situate their ideas, able to take all sorts of changing sides with the initiative to challenge and confront.\nThe Monitor\u2019s suggestions may or may not be directly relevant to the philosopher\u2019s work, but act as reference guides \u2013 to which the philosopher might think, \u201cthat\u2019s a related idea, maybe there\u2019s a connection here\u201d or \u201cthat doesn\u2019t seem directly related, but it\u2019s good to have in mind\u201d.\nMoreover, the Monitor may ask a variety of uncomfortable and unexpected methodological questions aimed at clarifying philosophers\u2019 decisions.\nThe Respondent  high-selfhood, low-initiative.\nAs philosophers develop their ideas, they want to understand how others might react \u2013 better understanding possible misinterpretations, objections, and clarification questions which may arise (P6, P10, P12).\nthese reactions should have high selfhood to be substantive and particular, and low initiative to remain directly focused on the user\u2019s ideas.\nAs a role for LMs, the Respondent adopts a specific set of beliefs and perspectives and reacts directly to the user\u2019s ideas; it does not merely role-play or superficially caricature different positions, but should have consistent memories and beliefs which are reasonably open to change (P4) rather than dogmatically fixed.\nInteractions with the Respondent may inform how the philosopher formulates and presents their ideas; they may anticipate certain objections and strengthen its appeal and utility.\nThe Respondent can also be counterfactually helpful: if an agent representing an unsavory position resonates with a philosopher\u2019s argument, then that philosopher might reconsider how their argument is expressed, not only defending but also delimiting the scope of their argument (P6)."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation, Research Problem, and Relevant Prior Work\n\n**Motivation:**\nThe paper is driven by a deep-seated curiosity about whether Language Models (LMs), which have become prolific tools in assisting various intellectual and creative tasks, can be leveraged as tools for critical thinking. The premise anchors on the juxtaposition of current LMs\u2019 capabilities, which primarily alleviate intellectual inconveniences, and the more profound necessity of fostering deep, reflective, and skeptical thinking \u2013 characteristics central to disciplines such as philosophy. By examining the potential of LMs beyond their conventional uses, the paper aims to explore the realm where these models can aid in complex intellectual engagements rather than just speeding up cognitive processes or bypassing them entirely.\n\n**Research Problem:**\nThe main research problem is to evaluate whether current Language Models can serve as effective tools for critical thinking, particularly within the domain of philosophy. This involves understanding how LMs align or misalign with the critical thinking processes of philosophers, identifying limitations in current LMs when it comes to engaging in deep intellectual discourse, and proposing models that could enhance their functionality as critical thinking aids. Specifically, the investigation seeks to explore:\n1. The current views and experiences of professional philosophers regarding LMs.\n2. The reasons why philosophers find current LMs inadequate for critical thinking.\n3. Potential roles that LMs could play to better support critical thinking in philosophical inquiry.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\n1. **Code Writing and Text Generation:** Previous studies have shown that LMs can assist in writing code (Chen et al., 2021; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2024) and generating emails (Goodman et al., 2022) as well as translating texts (Costa-juss\u00e0 et al., 2022).\n2. **Creativity and Idea Spark:** LMs have been used to generate stories (Schwitzgebel et al., 2023) and concept designs (Ma et al., 2023), showcasing their potential in sparking new ideas and thoughts.\n3. **Writing Assistance:** LMs also aid in putting thoughts into words by revising writing (Mysore et al., 2023) and providing feedback (Liang et al., 2023).\n4. **Critical Thinking:** The concept of critical thinking, defined as \u201cthe propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism\u201d (McPeck, 2016), forms the theoretical underpinning of this study. The authors connect this notion with the philosophical practice of thinking deeply and critically about various concepts and ideas.\n\nThrough these foundational works, the paper situates its investigation within the broader context of how LMs currently function and their potential evolution to support deeper intellectual activities.",
        "methodology": "The methodology for the study \"Language Models as Critical Thinking Tools: A Case Study of Philosophers\" involves a qualitative analysis based on interviews conducted with professional philosophers. Here is an overview of the proposed method or model, including key components and innovations:\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **Participant Selection**:\n    - Interviews were conducted with 21 professional philosophers from 14 philosophy departments at doctoral universities in the United States.\n    - Philosophers were chosen to ensure high diversity in their areas of interest, such as ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of science.\n\n2. **Interview Process**:\n    - The interviews took place online, lasting between 30 to 60 minutes, contingent on the interviewee's availability.\n    - Interviewees were questioned on their methods of philosophizing, including where their ideas originate, how they develop their ideas, and what resources they require.\n    - Additionally, participants were asked about their views on Language Models (LMs), such as whether LMs can \"do\" philosophy and how they might be useful in philosophizing.\n\n3. **Script and Flexibility**:\n    - The questions followed a loose script (referenced in \u00a7A.1), with flexibility to ask novel follow-up questions based on the interviewees' responses to delve deeper into interesting areas.\n\n4. **Interaction with LMs**:\n    - For those philosophers with little or no prior exposure to LMs, they interacted live with the GPT-4 model on a philosophical topic of their choosing during the interview.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**:\n    - The study received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the university. \n    - All interviewees provided consent to participate and for their responses to be used in the development of the article.\n\n### Innovations in Method:\n\n- **Inductive and Open Coding Analysis**:\n    - Interviews were analyzed both via recordings and transcripts using an inductive approach as per Thomas (2006) and open coding as described by Charmaz (2006). \n    - This method helped identify common themes and positions, which structured sections (\u00a74 and \u00a75) of the analysis.\n\n- **Unique Identifiers for Reliability**:\n    - Interviewees are referred to with unique identifiers (e.g., P1, P2, P3) to cite their responses accurately and maintain confidentiality.\n\nThis methodological approach allowed the researchers to gather a broad spectrum of perspectives on the role and potential of LMs in philosophical practice, providing a nuanced understanding of how these tools can intersect with traditional and contemporary philosophical methods.\n",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup and Results:**\n\n**Experiment Setup:**\n- **Participants:** The experiment involved interviewing multiple philosophers (referred to with IDs such as P1, P2, P13, etc.) to gather their perspectives on the utility of Language Models (LMs) as tools for critical thinking.\n- **Purpose:** The aim was to assess to what extent current LMs can assist philosophers in their intellectual processes, both in routine tasks and in contexts requiring deep critical thinking.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics and Methodology:**\n- *Qualitative Interviews:* Philosophers were asked about their experiences and perspectives regarding the use of LMs.\n- *Relevance and Utility:* Philosophers\u2019 responses were categorized based on their views on the relevance and potential uses of LMs.\n- *Critical Thinking Evaluation:* Specific attention was given to whether philosophers found LMs capable of assisting in complex intellectual and critical thinking tasks.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\n1. **Findings on Relevance and Utility:**\n   - Many philosophers found LMs to be relevant and interesting.\n   - Some identified limited practical uses for LMs, particularly in contexts like undergraduate instruction (mentioned by P1, P13, P20) or for getting acquainted with new topics (noted by P5, P11, P12).\n\n2. **Critical Thinking Limitations:**\n   - None of the interviewed philosophers were convinced that current LMs can reliably and conveniently assist in intellectually substantive ways that require critical thinking.\n   - Descriptive terms used by philosophers to characterize LMs included \u201cboring\u201d (P2), \u201canodyne\u201d (P4), \u201cbland\u201d (P9), and \u201ccowardly\u201d (P13).\n\n3. **Reasons for Limitations:**\n   - **Neutrality and Detachment:** LMs were perceived as highly neutral, detached, and non-judgmental, making comments in abstract and decontextualized ways.\n   - **Passive and Incurious Behavior:** LMs were seen as servile and passive, which restricted their usefulness, particularly when the user did not have a clear vision of what they wanted to achieve.\n\nThis summary of the main experiment provides insight into the perceived capabilities and shortcomings of current LMs from the perspective of professional philosophers, emphasizing a significant gap in the ability of these models to support tasks demanding deep intellectual engagement and critical thinking."
