    "abstract": "As natural language models like ChatGPT become increasingly prevalent in applications and services, the need for robust and accurate methods to detect their output is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present GPT Reddit Dataset (GRiD), a novel Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-generated text detection dataset designed to assess the performance of detection models in identifying generated responses from ChatGPT. The dataset consists of a diverse collection of context-prompt pairs based on Reddit, with human-generated and ChatGPT-generated responses. We provide an analysis of the dataset\u2019s characteristics, including linguistic diversity, context complexity, and response quality. To showcase the dataset\u2019s utility, we benchmark several detection methods on it, demonstrating their efficacy in distinguishing between human and ChatGPT-generated responses. This dataset serves as a resource for evaluating and advancing detection techniques in the context of ChatGPT and contributes to the ongoing efforts to ensure responsible and trustworthy AI-driven communication on the internet. Finally, we propose GpTen, a novel tensor-based GPT text detection method that is semi-supervised in nature since it only has access to human-generated text and performs on par with fully-supervised baselines.",

            "text": "Detection of Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-generated content has gained significant relevance with the proliferation of large language models over the internet. These models, including GPT-3, produce human-like text that can be seamlessly integrated into various applications and platforms (Brown et al., 2020). However, the potential misuse of such generated content for misinformation, spam, or other malicious purposes has raised the importance of detecting GPT-generated text (Crothers et al., 2023). In diverse contexts like social media, customer service, and content generation, distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated text has become crucial to maintaining trust, security, and the integrity of online discourse. Detecting GPT-generated text helps mitigate the risk of spreading disinformation, ensures ethical AI use, and enhances content quality and reliability in applications harnessing AI language models.\n\nThere are quite a few approaches that exist for GPT detection (Crothers et al., 2023). We can sort a majority of the approaches into a few categories: traditional supervised machine learning, deep learning methods, transfer learning methods, and unsupervised methods.\n\nTraditional supervised machine learning methods have been extensively employed for GPT detection (Li et al., 2020). These approaches leverage labeled datasets, where human-generated and machine-generated text samples are used to train classifiers. One of the key advantages of this approach is its interpretability, as it allows for the examination of features used by classifiers to make predictions. However, traditional supervised methods often require substantial manual annotation efforts to create labeled datasets, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, they require large amounts of training data, with the risk of overfitting, and may struggle to adapt to evolving GPT models and the diverse ways in which they are employed, making them less effective in dynamic environments such as the modern web.\n\nDeep learning methods, on the other hand, are prominent for their ability to automatically learn complex patterns from data (Li et al., 2020). These methods, such as neural networks, can effectively capture the nuanced characteristics of GPT-generated text. Deep learning models excel in handling unstructured data, but they tend to be data-hungry and may demand large training datasets for optimal performance. They are widely used due to their robustness and adaptability, especially when substantial labeled data is available.\n\nTransfer learning methods have emerged as a highly practical solution for GPT detection. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on specific tasks, transfer learning allows for efficient use of available resources while inheriting the knowledge and capabilities of the pre-trained models, which can be particularly advantageous in scenarios with limited training data (Ruder et al., 2019). However, transfer learning methods may not always generalize well to diverse GPT variants and applications, which can restrict their usefulness.\n\nUnsupervised methods represent a different paradigm, where GPT detection is achieved without the need for labeled data. These methods rely on various statistical and linguistic cues to identify machine-generated content (Haj-Yahia et al., 2019). Unsupervised approaches are advantageous for their independence from labeled datasets but can be less accurate and robust compared to supervised or deep learning methods. They are less commonly used in practice due to their limitations, especially in the face of evolving GPT models and sophisticated adversarial techniques.\n\nTraditional supervised machine learning and deep learning methods are commonly favored for their accuracy and adaptability, while transfer learning methods offer a pragmatic balance between data efficiency and effectiveness. Unsupervised methods, although less commonly used, offer a label-free alternative but may lag in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially in complex and evolving GPT environments.\n\nOur contributions in this paper are:\nDataset: we present GPT Reddit Dataset (GRiD), a dataset designed and built for GPT detection. We make our dataset publicly available.\nNovel Method: we propose GpTen: a novel semi-supervised tensor-based method with comparable results to existing fully supervised approaches for GPT detection.\nExperimental Evaluation: we extensively evaluate how state-of-the-art existing approaches behave on our dataset.\n\nOur dataset and implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/madlab-ucr/GriD."

            "text": "The GPT Reddit Dataset (GRiD) is a comprehensive collection of text data obtained from two distinct sources: Reddit and the OpenAI API. It is structured to encompass a total of 6513 samples, further categorized into two primary groups: 1368 samples represent text content generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model, whereas 5145 samples denote text authored by human contributors. Each individual sample within the dataset is labeled to indicate its source of generation, differentiating between GPT-generated and human-generated text. In order to minimize the potential mixture of GPT-generated data with human-generated data, all data from human contributors is dated from October 31, 2022, or earlier, which is the official release date of the ChatGPT web application.\n\nThe dataset is stored in a structured CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. Each line in the CSV file consists of a data sample and its corresponding label. The GPT-generated data contained within this dataset is a result of interactions with the GPT-3.5-turbo model provided by the OpenAI API. To solicit responses from the model, a specific prompt was employed: \u201cYou are a frequent user of the subreddits \u00a1subreddit_names\u00bf. Answer anything relevant.\u201d The model\u2019s responses to these prompts are integral to the GPT-generated portion of the dataset.\n\nIn order to promote further research in this direction, we make this dataset publicly accessible to the research community on GitHub."

We sourced the Reddit data from three different subreddits: AskHistorians, AskScience, and ExplainLikeImFive. In order to consider a post from each subreddit, they had to satisfy all of the following criteria:  \n\n- The post must be dated before November 2022.  \n- The post must have at least a score (upvotes) of 1000.  \n- The post does not contain adult content.  \n- The post is in English.  \n- The post title is formatted as a question.  \n- The post itself cannot be deleted.  \n\nWe can justify each criterion separately. The following is a justification for each criterion:  \n\n- ChatGPT was officially released to the public in November 2022. In order to ensure minimal representation of GPT in the human-generated data, we only considered posts before that date.  \n- We only consider the top posts from each subreddit. Posts with at least 1000 upvotes were generally appropriate for the dataset.  \n- Since the dataset is for academic research purposes, we avoid any adult posts.  \n- The dataset is only intended to be comprised of English-based content at this time.  \n- Each post title is fed into GPT as a prompt, so in order to reduce noise and increase consistency between the human-generated and GPT-generated content.  \n- Some posts on Reddit are deleted by moderators of the subreddit, but their metadata still exists on the subreddit. For fairness, we filter out these posts from the dataset.  \n\nFor the current dataset, we gather up to the top 500 posts from each subreddit which satisfy the above criteria. For each post, we gather up to 5 of the top comments based on score (upvotes), and then feed the post title into GPT and store the corresponding response. Each comment only needs to satisfy a simpler criterion to be considered:  \n\n- The comment is in English.  \n- The comment is not deleted.  "

Specifically, we remove links and any other non-text multi-modal information from the Reddit data. Links can exist in both markdown formatting (text)[link] as well as general URL formatting, so we must handle both uniquely. We extract the text from links in markdown formatting and remove the link and special characters. For generic URLs, we simply remove them since GPT-3.5 does not generate links.\n\nSpecial characters that are not representative of typical punctuation are also removed. An example is bold characters in markdown, which are encapsulated by * characters. We also remove newline characters from human-generated content, as they are not present in GPT-generated text. Other bias exists in human-generated content, such as personal anecdotes and nuanced contextual understanding, but said bias can be harnessed to discern human-generated content from GPT-generated content since GPT can attempt to replicate said biases through more advanced prompting techniques.\n\nWe filter out Reddit data with profanity or other inappropriate content using the better-profanity library, since GPT does not typically use any profanity or generate inappropriate content unless specifically prompted to do so. The better-profanity library can filter most inappropriate content automatically, but any leftover data has been manually filtered. We also filter out any human-generated content under 100 characters in length, as these comments are short and typically lacking in substance."

            "section_name": "3. Proposed Method",
            "text": "###figure_1### We propose GpTen, a novel method for anomaly detection that leverages tensor decomposition to identify underlying patterns in the data. Specifically, we are leveraging the fact that comparing the reconstruction of a tensor built from its decomposed components to the original may show that the original tensor contains anomalies, if a significant difference between the two exists. This type of tensor representation has been successfully applied to two very different language tasks: fake news detection (Guacho et al., 2018  ###reference_b4###) and humor recognition (Zhao et al., 2019a  ###reference_b10###). So its reasonable that this method can also be applied directly to GPT detection, and we have applied it to the task using this dataset. The proposed method is structured as a pipeline and consists of a few major components, which this section will describe in detail. This approach is considered semi-supervised based on the first step.\nThe first step of the pipeline is to construct a three-dimensional tensor of the corresponding input data. In most cases, the tensor should represent the in-distribution data. If this is the case, then any positive data points will be excluded from the tensor, hence the semi-supervised approach.\nWe build the tensor as follows. For each document in the data, we build a co-occurrence matrix for each term and its neighbors within a window size (typically 5 to 10). Each co-occurrence matrix is an  matrix, where M represents the number of unique terms in the entire collection of documents. So, given a collection  with  documents, we will construct an  tensor where each slice of the tensor is an  co-occurrence of document ; there are  such co-occurrence matrices (Fig. 1  ###reference_###).\nAn important distinction is that we are only using human-generated content to build the tensor. Since we require labeled non-GPT data in order to build the tensor, we consider this method semi-supervised. Simultaneously, we only use terms from the human-generated content to build the the co-occurrence matrices in order to avoid any potential contamination from the test set.\nThe second step of the pipeline is to decompose the tensor. For our proposed method, we employ the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD)(Guacho et al., 2018  ###reference_b4###) to decompose the tensor into factor matrices.\n###figure_2### The third step of the pipeline is to project and reconstruct each slice of the tensor using the decomposed factor matrices. Specifically, we want to construct a vector  of length  which contains the reconstruction error of each slice in the tensor (Fig. 2  ###reference_###). Since the input tensor is three dimensional, CPD decomposition calculates three corresponding factor matrices , and C of dimensions , ,  respectively, where  represents the rank of the decomposition. We will then project each slice of the tensor, denoted as , through the factor matrices A and B, to get the projection  as .\nWe can then calculate the reconstruction  for each slice  as\n\nThe reconstruction  will be of dimension , which is the same as . We can then take the Frobenius norm to calculate the reconstruction error  of each slice :\n.\nThe reconstruction errors follow a distribution which can be modelled by both supervised and unsupervised models, however, given that our method only has access to negative labels (i.e., human-generated text), we employ unsupervised anomaly detection to model the reconstruction error distribution and identify positive (i.e., GPT-generated text) as O.O.D points."

The selection of these models is intended to explore a spectrum of approaches (Crothers et al., 2023 ###reference_b3###).  \n\nFor both SVM and Random Forest, we applied a simple TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the text data into numerical data (Jones, 1972 ###reference_b6###), which is then fed into both models. All results are obtained via 10-fold cross-validation.  \n\nBERT-based models stand as state-of-the-art models in natural language processing and represents the cutting edge of deep learning-based text understanding (Crothers et al., 2023 ###reference_b3###). Its ability to contextualize words within a sentence and grasp intricate semantic relationships makes it an ideal candidate for the task of distinguishing between human-generated and GPT-generated text. For this reason, we have chosen a pre-trained baseline BERT model for experimentation."

This observation aligns with the expectations set by the choice of models, with BERT leveraging its advanced contextual understanding to discern the nuances of GPT-generated text. SVM, representing a traditional ML approach, demonstrated respectable performance, while Random Forest, as an ensemble method, showcased its ability to capture certain patterns but fell short of the performance achieved by BERT. Despite being outperformed, SVM and Random Forest remain viable options for GPT-generated text detection due to their interpretable structure and efficiency in handling high-dimensional feature spaces. These traditional machine learning approaches offer transparency in model predictions and can serve as practical alternatives, particularly when computational resources are constrained or interpretability is an important consideration. For GpTen, we compare the results of applying an unsupervised model for anomaly detection on the calculated reconstruction errors. We apply models from the PyOD library, a comprehensive Python library for outlier detection. PyOD supports both supervised and unsupervised models, and in both cases provides a simple abstraction to gather predictions and metrics from the model. For unsupervised models, the anomaly scores given to each data point by the model are converted to a prediction by applying a threshold. The best performing unsupervised model from our experiments was the KDE model, which assesses the likelihood of each data point by estimating its probability density function based on a non-parametric approach, identifying anomalies as instances with lower likelihoods."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation\nThe motivation behind this paper is grounded in the increasing relevance and usage of Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), particularly models like GPT-3, which are capable of producing highly convincing human-like text. While these models offer substantial benefits in various applications, there is a significant risk of misuse, particularly in contexts involving misinformation, spam, or other malicious activities. The ability to distinguish between human-authored and AI-generated content has become essential to maintaining the integrity, security, and trust of online discourse across various platforms, such as social media and customer service.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe research problem emerges from the necessity to detect GPT-generated content reliably amidst its widespread adoption. Existing approaches to GPT detection are categorized into traditional supervised machine learning, deep learning, transfer learning, and unsupervised methods. Each of these has specific advantages and drawbacks, such as the need for large labeled datasets, the risk of overfitting, and the challenge of adapting to new and evolving GPT models. The primary problem this paper aims to address is the development of more efficient and effective methods for detecting GPT-generated text, particularly in ways that can overcome the limitations of current techniques.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Traditional Supervised Machine Learning (Li et al., 2020)**:\n   - Utilizes labeled datasets to train classifiers that distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated text.\n   - Advantages include the interpretability of feature-based model predictions.\n   - Drawbacks include the need for substantial manual annotation, risk of overfitting, and challenges in adapting to new GPT models.\n\n2. **Deep Learning Methods (Li et al., 2020)**:\n   - Able to automatically learn complex data patterns, making them highly effective at capturing the nuances of GPT-generated text.\n   - Excel in handling unstructured data but require large training datasets and are data-hungry.\n\n3. **Transfer Learning Methods (Ruder et al., 2019)**:\n   - Leverage pre-trained models fine-tuned for specific tasks, addressing some limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n   - Efficient when training data is limited but may not generalize well across diverse GPT variants.\n\n4. **Unsupervised Methods (Haj-Yahia et al., 2019)**:\n   - Detect GPT-generated content without labeled data by relying on statistical and linguistic cues.\n   - Independent from labeled datasets but generally less accurate and robust compared to supervised or deep learning methods.\n\n### Contributions\n1. **Dataset**: The paper introduces the GPT Reddit Dataset (GRiD), designed specifically for GPT detection and made publicly available for the research community.\n2. **Novel Method**: Proposes GpTen, a semi-supervised tensor-based detection method that achieves results comparable to fully supervised methods.\n3. **Experimental Evaluation**: Provides extensive evaluation of current state-of-the-art approaches on the GRiD dataset.\n\nThe authors make their dataset and implementation publicly accessible, demonstrating a commitment to advancing GPT detection research through open science.",
        "methodology": "**Methodology: GPT-generated Text Detection: Benchmark Dataset and Tensor-based Detection Method**\n\n**Overview:**\nWe present GpTen, an innovative approach for anomaly detection utilizing tensor decomposition to identify underlying patterns in the data. Specifically, we utilize the fact that discrepancies between the reconstructed tensor (from its decomposed components) and the original tensor suggest anomalies. This tensor representation method, previously successful in tasks like fake news detection and humor recognition, is applied here for detecting GPT-generated text.\n\n**Pipeline Structure:**\nThe pipeline consists of several key components:\n\n1. **Tensor Construction:**\n   - **Data Representation:** For each document, we construct co-occurrence matrices for terms and their neighbors within a window size (typically 5-10).\n   - **Forming the Tensor:** Each co-occurrence matrix is an \\(M \\times M\\) matrix, where \\(M\\) is the number of unique terms. Given \\(N\\) documents, this results in a \\(N \\times M \\times M\\) tensor, where each tensor slice represents a document's term co-occurrences.\n   - **Input Data Focus:** The tensor is built using only human-generated content, making the method semi-supervised as it excludes GPT-generated text.\n\n2. **Tensor Decomposition:**\n   - **Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD):** We decompose the tensor into factor matrices using CPD. Specifically, the input tensor \\(X\\) is decomposed into three factor matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) corresponding to different dimensions.\n\n3. **Projection and Reconstruction:**\n   - **Projection Calculation:** Each tensor slice is projected through the factor matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to obtain projections.\n   - **Reconstruction of Slices:** We then reconstruct each tensor slice from these projections using the factor matrices.\n   - **Reconstruction Error:** The difference between the original and reconstructed slices is quantified using the Frobenius norm, producing a reconstruction error vector for anomaly detection.\n\n4. **Anomaly Detection:**\n   - **Error Distribution Modeling:** The reconstruction errors form a distribution modeled by unsupervised methods since the method has access only to negative (human-generated) labels.\n   - **O.O.D Point Identification:** Positive labels (GPT-generated text) are identified as out-of-distribution (O.O.D) points based on the reconstruction error distribution.\n\n**Key Components and Innovations:**\n- **Tensor Construction from Co-occurrence Matrices:** Representing documents as co-occurrence matrices within a tensor framework.\n- **Semi-supervised Learning:** Leveraging human-generated content to avoid contamination and facilitate anomaly detection.\n- **CPD Tensor Decomposition:** Utilizing CPD to break down and analyze the tensor.\n- **Reconstruction Error Analysis:** Using the Frobenius norm to quantify reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies.\n\nThis methodology provides a robust framework for detecting GPT-generated text by capitalizing on tensor-based techniques and semi-supervised learning approaches.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup and Results:\n\n#### Models:\n1. **Random Forest**\n2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**\n3. **BERT (pre-trained baseline)**\n\n#### Data Transformation for SVM and Random Forest:\n- A simple TF-IDF vectorizer is employed to convert text data into numerical data, which is then utilized by both models.\n\n#### Evaluation Process:\n- All results are gathered through 10-fold cross-validation for robustness and reliability.\n\n#### Selection Rationale:\n- The choice of Random Forest and SVM explores traditional machine learning approaches leveraging TF-IDF representations.\n- The BERT model is selected due to its state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing and its capacity to handle intricate semantic relationships within the text.\n\n#### Main Results:\n- **[Not provided directly in the prompt, thus cannot be completed.
