    "title": "Inside the echo chamber: Linguistic underpinnings of misinformation on Twitter",
    "abstract": "Social media users drive the spread of misinformation online by sharing posts that include erroneous information or commenting on controversial topics with unsubstantiated arguments often in earnest. Work on echo chambers has suggested that users\u2019 perspectives are reinforced through repeated interactions with like-minded peers, promoted by homophily and bias in information diffusion. Building on long-standing interest in the social bases of language and linguistic underpinnings of social behavior, this work explores how conversations around misinformation are mediated through language use. We compare a number of linguistic measures, e.g., in-/out-group cues and discourse connectives, within and across topics of conversation and user communities. Our findings reveal increased presence of group identity signals within echo chambers during discussions of misinformation. We discuss the specific character of these broader trends across topics and examine contextual influences.",

            "text": "In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have developed into a primary source of news for a growing majority of the US population (Levy, 2021  ###reference_b40###). As OSNs have expanded, so have concerns about the role of social media in promoting misinformation and deepening social fissures (Allcott et al., 2019  ###reference_b5###; Zimdars and McLeod, 2020  ###reference_b82###), the consequences of which were particularly tangible during the COVID-19 pandemic and response (Abrams and Greenhawt, 2020  ###reference_b2###; Brennen et al., 2020  ###reference_b14###; Bursztyn et al., 2020  ###reference_b17###).\n\nUser interactions in OSNs are scaffolded by platforms\u2019 algorithms and moderation practices. Optimized primarily for engagement, these algorithms promote interaction with like-minded peers and isolate users from disagreeable content. While this can create safe spaces for individuals to share opinions and find validation, it can also drive polarization (Barber\u00e1, 2020  ###reference_b9###; Cinelli et al., 2021  ###reference_b20###; Rhodes, 2022  ###reference_b60###). Some have suggested that the effects of so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers have been overstated or oversimplified and have argued for a more nuanced characterization based on, e.g., ideology or topic of discussion (Barber\u00e1 et al., 2015  ###reference_b10###; Bruns, 2017  ###reference_b16###; Guess et al., 2018  ###reference_b34###). Irrespective, these phenomena speak to the broader, well-studied phenomenon of homophily in social group formation (McPherson et al., 2001  ###reference_b46###; Currarini et al., 2009  ###reference_b24###). In the online setting, user-generated content facilitates aggregation around shared interests and worldviews, which in turn serves to support the deepening and reinforcement of social ties (Del Vicario et al., 2016  ###reference_b26###).\n\nAt the heart of OSN communities is discourse rich with linguistic signals of individual and relational identities. That is, users of language perform their identities within the uses of language (Benwell, 2006  ###reference_b12###; Zappavigna, 2014  ###reference_b80###; Zhang et al., 2017  ###reference_b81###). This is both heightened and complicated by the affordances of social media (Tagg and Seargeant, 2014  ###reference_b68###). Identities are partially performed through alignment with communities, opinions, and cultural issues (Tagg and Seargeant, 2014  ###reference_b68###). Online, this can be enacted as direct engagement and participation in groups, or through indirect interactions, e.g., hashtagging, sharing memes (Zappavigna, 2011  ###reference_b78###, 2014  ###reference_b80###), or even simple repetition (Rosenblum and Muirhead, 2019  ###reference_b63###).\n\nSeveral schools of thought have driven work to understand the co-evolution of language, social ties, and the environment (Group\u201d et al., 2009  ###reference_b33###; Lupyan and Dale, 2010  ###reference_b43###; Roberts and Winters, 2012  ###reference_b62###; Bentz et al., 2018  ###reference_b11###; Raviv et al., 2020  ###reference_b56###). Languages adapt to the constraints and biases of their learners, which include social, physical and technological contexts (Dale and Lupyan, 2012  ###reference_b25###; Lupyan and Dale, 2016  ###reference_b44###). Foundational work in sociolinguistics, for example, has studied the ways in which language change correlates with social network dynamics (Milroy and Milroy, 1992  ###reference_b47###; Blommaert, 2010  ###reference_b13###). Shared linguistic features can enhance so-called processing fluency, making communications more effective and reinforcing community bonds (Canestrino et al., 2022  ###reference_b18###; Pancer et al., 2019  ###reference_b49###). Within the landscape of social media, both notions of community and language practices are flexible and interactively constructed (Tagg and Seargeant, 2014  ###reference_b68###).\n\nOur work is a study of the relationships between social media users\u2019 linguistic patterns and the community structures in which they are embedded. We have selected misinformation as our point of"

When a group identity becomes prominent, individuals develop their self-concept around paradigmatic ingroup characteristics (Brewer et al., 1999  ###reference_b15###). They are motivated to differentiate between their ingroup and relevant outgroups (Li and Su, 2020  ###reference_b41###). Social identity theory has been engaged to describe political group formation in online social communities, e.g., (Greene, 2004  ###reference_b32###; Trepte and Loy, 2017  ###reference_b72###).\nRecent work (Li and Su, 2020  ###reference_b41###) looked at discussions containing the term \u201cfake news\u201d on Twitter and found an uptrend in the use of identity language, as measured by increased frequency of group pronouns. They also found that group pronouns were likely to collocate with words boosting ingroup messaging. These findings dovetail with concerns about polarization. Rathje et al. (Rathje et al., 2021  ###reference_b55###) found out-group animosity to be a predictor of engagement on Facebook and Twitter, due in part to algorithmic designs favoring messages containing out-group antagonism. Our work operationalizes linguistic indicators of social identity as in-/out-group reference language."

More than just categorization, the act of hashtagging serves as an instrument of social group identity formation. By selecting specific hashtags, users signal an allegiance or a stance, fostering both inclusion within communities and distinction from others. Consistent patterns of hashtagging behaviors can solidify these group identities, creating online communities unified by shared narratives and ideologies (Zappavigna, 2012  ###reference_b79###, 2014  ###reference_b80###)."

People are more likely to judge information favorably if they are able to digest it easily.

We concentrate on the model\u2019s non-zero component because it remains largely unaffected by extreme outliers, specifically instances where the content is very short thus not containing target vocabularies. The coefficient of the predictor variable in this regression, which represents echo chamber membership, provides an estimate of the log odds ratio of the change in identity measurement in response to echo chamber membership. If this coefficient is positive and statistically significant, it suggests that membership to an echo chamber is associated with higher log odds of using group pronouns. Recognizing that analyses with large datasets often yields small, less informative p-values, we employ a stratified random sampling method (Fox and Weisberg, 2002  ###reference_b30###). This involves selecting 1000 data points each from echo chamber and non-echo chamber data subsets (2000 total), ensuring a balanced representation of both categories. To address potential small sample biases and enhance the robustness of our findings, we conduct 1,000 iterations of this regression analysis, obtaining median values for the coefficient, standard error, T-score, and p-value.

Some hashtags are slogan-like, e.g., #WWG1WGA (\u201cWhere We Go One, We Go All\u201d) and #kag (\u201cKeep America Great\u201d).\nHashtag networks.\nHashtag network statistics are provided in Table 4  ###reference_###. In the QAnon echo chamber, the hashtag network exhibits the highest density, suggesting a deliberate and strategic approach to hashtag bulk use, likely for content promotion. Additionally, we see high percentage of ambient affiliation engagement and average common hashtags per paired users for election fraud, which is consistent with the high identity consolidation observed within election fraud discussions. Conversely, we observe limited hashtag usage within anti-vaccination discourse, which is also mirrored in the network structure. These findings highlight the complex nature of online discourse and nuance under the very broad umbrella of misinformation-related conversations."

            "text": "We observe strongest group identity formation within US election fraud discourse. To further explore this, we conduct a case study analyzing interactions within, between, and outside echo chambers. We find that echo chamber members are deeply embedded in the broader interaction network, maintaining active engagements with individuals outside their group. This heightened activity of echo chamber members in external interactions challenges the simplistic view of echo chambers as entirely insular entities and suggests a more nuanced understanding of discourse dynamics.\nFigure 2  ###reference_### shows the internal interaction network amongst members of the largest echo chamber (red) and other echo chamber members with which they interact. We observe echo chambers are interconnected rather than isolated. Two nodes, in particular, exhibit highest centrality: Node ECa, a member of the largest echo chamber; and, ECb, a bridge between echo chambers.\nDeeper examination of the content shared by these two nodes reveals distinct roles.\nNode ECa emerges as a pivotal resource hub, disseminating information about the election status, often accompanied by a URL. These URLs typically redirect to tweets conveying similar content, supplemented by relevant hashtags.\nFurthermore, we notice several indicators of group identity from ECa that extend beyond our initial examination of first and third-person plural pronouns. This content manifests as expressions of favoritism and support within the group or, conversely, as extreme animosity towards those outside the group. For instance:\nGood morning @realDonaldTrump. I\u2019m still here, standing with you and 70 million other freedom loving patriots. It time to expose the #voterfraud. #DoNotConcede #DoNotConcedeUnderAnyCircumstances\n#DoNotGiveUp\nGDMRNNG (The vowels have been stolen by Democrats) #Election2020 #VoterFraud #BidenHarris2020 #2020Elections (Explanation: GDMRNNG is goodmorning without vowels.)\nWe observe that ECb mainly interacts with itself. Among 111 tweets posted by ECb, 93 are retweets or replies to its own tweets. Within this set of tweets, we notice: heavy use of user mentioning, an average of 46.32 mentions per tweet; use of hashtags, an average of 5.7 hashtags per tweet; and ending the post with a URL.\n###figure_2### ###table_4###"

As the datasets being compared exhibit approximately normal distribution and similar variances, we employ an independent two-sample T-test. Given our relatively large dataset, this test tends to yield very small p-values, hence less informative. To mitigate this effect or potential non-normality in distribution, we perform bootstrapping by randomly sampling 1000 data points from both the echo chamber and non-echo chamber groups and conducting the t-test over 1000 iterations (Lumley et al., 2002; Ahad et al., 2012; Faber and Fonseca, 2014).

Our findings consistently indicate that all misinformation topics yield a lower average percentage of big words in echo chamber posts compared to non-echo chamber posts, with all p-values less than 0.05.

Conversely, in the context of the control topics Monday Motivation and BLM, an entirely opposite behavior is observed; echo chambers tend to exhibit a lower prevalence of discourse connectives, aligning with our findings above that suggest greater simplicity in these communities.\n\nGenerally speaking, we might expect fewer discourse connectives in echo chambers due to greater preexisting consensus amongst members. However, the nature of some misinformation-related topics requires more elaboration and explanation, and might explain the increased use of connectives in these contexts.\n\nIn line with prior work on QAnon, we also note cues of explanation-oriented behavior within QAnon echo chambers, co-occurring with straightforward vocabulary. QAnon proponents often use phrases like \u201cdo the research.\u201d These phrases appear to steer users toward an archive of QAnon-related information, likely intended for persuasive or reinforcing purposes. For instance:\n\nThere are many sides to any issue. It doesn't matter what others think. What matters is what you think. Do the research. Dig. Come to your own conclusion. Seek the truth knowing that you will never know what TRUTH really is, but come as close as you possibly can. #QAnon \n\nPeople no longer have the luxury of claiming ignorance is why they believe the things they believe. We are living in a time where the truth can be easily accessed via documentation, YouTube, QAnon, and even if you don\u2019t want to do the research there are many who do and give.\n\nA pattern in many such tweets is the inclusion of URLs, guiding users to external sources, e.g., news articles, videos, or other tweets to \u201cvalidate\u201d claims.

We explore whether echo chamber members exhibit increased URL usage, as compared to external nodes. To examine this, we assess URL density in interactions within echo chambers, outside echo chambers, and in standalone original tweets across our three misinformation topics, as shown in Figure 4 ###reference_###.\n\nNotably, we observe a consistently higher URL density in isolated posts across all misinformation-related topics. Conversely, echo chamber interactions tend to utilize URLs less frequently, perhaps suggesting that users within echo chambers may not feel the need to persuade each other with new information, given their synchronized beliefs.\n\nIn between-topic comparisons, QAnon discussions have most frequent URL usage, followed by election fraud. In contrast, discussions about anti-vaccination do not engage as much with URLs. Among QAnon tweets, 73.68% contains at least one URL, in comparison to Election Fraud (69.81%) and Antivax (44.45%).\n\nThis trend is accentuated when considering tweets with at least two URLs. Within QAnon discourse, a substantial 10.82% of tweets fall into this category, as compared to 3.51% for US election fraud and 3.91% for anti-vaccination. Extensive use of URLs in QAnon discussions suggests a deliberate strategy to strengthen main assertions with multiple references. ###figure_4###"

We operationalize these theories through a suite of computational metrics and analyses, which let us test these theories in the wild through social media with a particular focus on discussions around misinformation-related topics. This approach also allows us to differentially explore echo chambers and understand their linguistic underpinnings.\n\nWe do not see uniform behavior across all misinformation topics. Perhaps surprisingly, anti-vaccination discourse shows distinct linguistic patterns from US election fraud and QAnon discussions. This may signify the differential impact of political group identities, in particular, on the linguistic characteristics of politically-charged topics. We also note that the neutral topic we selected (#mondaymotivation) consistently displays behaviors contrary to those of misinformation. This underscores that echo chamber dynamics are not uniform but are influenced by discourse.\n\nThese insights might enable identification of social communities prone to influence through anomalous linguistic signs. Moreover, understanding the anatomy of echo chambers offers a blueprint for designing more effective and targeted moderation strategies. By studying the linguistic underpinning of social communities around misinformation-related discussions, we offer a fresh perspective on dynamics of information dissemination in the digital age."

Given our intentional control over the total volume of tweets, it is an intrinsic outcome that different topics span different lengths of time. Future work should consider controlling for temporal variables to better understand the influence of time on our findings.\nAdditionally, here we employed a relatively strict, network structure-based definition of echo chambers using strongly connected components within topic-specific discourse. It is possible that other approaches to defining echo chambers would yield different insights.\nFinally, our study selected the zero-inflated beta model to analyze the relationship between echo chamber membership and linguistic patterns as it is suitable for the data distribution. The extensive size of our dataset results in the models being hyper-sensitive, detecting even the slightest deviations in values. This heightened sensitivity is not unique to this model but is observed in other tests we employed, such as permutation tests. As a remedy, we adopted bootstrapping across 1,000 iterations for all tests, using the median as a representative measure. Nevertheless, it is the direction and magnitude of the coefficients that offer deeper insights into the interplay between echo chamber dynamics and linguistic underpinnings in discussions."

        "paper_title": "Inside the echo chamber: Linguistic underpinnings of misinformation on Twitter",
        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation\n\nThe paper is motivated by the growing significance of Online Social Networks (OSNs) as a primary source of news and the concerns about their role in promoting misinformation and deepening social divides. This phenomenon was notably impactful during the COVID-19 pandemic. The influence of OSNs is driven in part by algorithms optimized for engagement, which encourage interaction with like-minded individuals, leading to polarization. However, the effects of such echo chambers and filter bubbles have been debated and warrant a nuanced investigation. Within this context, language plays a crucial role in community formation and misinformation spread, prompting an inquiry into the linguistic patterns within these echo chambers, especially concerning misinformation.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe core research problem is understanding how linguistic patterns and community structures intersect in the context of misinformation on social media. Specifically, the study seeks to determine whether signaling of group identity and heightened processing fluency are more pronounced in echo chambers during discussions involving misinformation. The focus is on exploring linguistic characteristics within these echo chambers and assessing the uniformity and context-dependence of these patterns.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\nThe introduction references several key studies and concepts relevant to the research problem:\n\n1. **Misinformation and Social Fissures**: Allcott et al. (2019), Zimdars and McLeod (2020), Abrams and Greenhawt (2020), Brennen et al. (2020), Bursztyn et al. (2020) have highlighted the role of OSNs in exacerbating misinformation and societal divides.\n  \n2. **Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles**: There is substantial debate about echo chambers and filter bubbles, with some suggesting an overstated impact and others insisting on a nuanced understanding based on ideology or the topic of discussion (Barber\u00e1 et al., 2015; Bruns, 2017; Guess et al., 2018).\n\n3. **Homophily and Social Groups**: The phenomenon of homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others, is well-studied in social sciences (McPherson et al., 2001; Currarini et al., 2009), showing that online content aggregation enhances social ties around shared interests.\n\n4. **Linguistic Signals and Identity**: Language as a performative tool for identity and community alignment has been examined extensively (Benwell, 2006; Zappavigna, 2014; Zhang et al., 2017), demonstrating how linguistic features can signify group membership.\n\n5. **Language Adaptation and Social Networks**: Sociolinguistics has addressed how language changes correlate with social network dynamics (Milroy and Milroy, 1992; Blommaert, 2010), and how shared linguistic features can improve processing fluency and enhance community bonds (Canestrino et al., 2022; Pancer et al., 2019).\n\n6. **Misinformation Spread**: Previous studies have suggested that misinformation spreads rapidly online (Karlova and Fisher, 2013; Kumar and Geethakumari, 2014; Del Vicario et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2018; Vosoughi et al., 2018).\n\nThis work builds upon these foundational studies to explore the nuanced linguistic dynamics within echo chambers, particularly with respect to misinformation dissemination in online social networks.",
        "methodology": "The methodology section of a paper on the linguistic underpinnings of misinformation on Twitter typically comprises two main components: key definitions and measures used throughout the study.\n\nThe proposed method or model may be described as follows:\n\n1. **Key Definitions**:\n    - **Misinformation**: In this context, misinformation refers to false or misleading information that is spread, often unintentionally. The study might provide a precise definition tailored to the Twitter platform.\n    - **Echo Chamber**: An 'echo chamber' is defined as an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. This might include the algorithms that prioritize content similar to what users have interacted with previously.\n\n2. **Measures**:\n    - **Linguistic Features**: These are the specific characteristics of language use that the study examines to identify the presence and propagation of misinformation. This might include word frequency, sentiment analysis, syntactic patterns, and rhetorical devices.\n    - **Network Analysis**: This involves examining the connections between Twitter users, such as who follows whom, retweet patterns, and mentions. The aim is to understand how information spreads within and between different user clusters or communities.\n    - **Content Analysis**: This method includes both quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze the content of tweets for the presence of misinformation. It might involve manual coding, machine learning classification, or a combination of both.\n    - **Engagement Metrics**: These include measures of user interaction with tweets, such as likes, retweets, and comments, to gauge the reach and impact of misinformation.\n\n3. **Innovations**:\n    - **Hybrid Models**: The study might introduce a hybrid approach, combining traditional linguistic analysis with advanced machine learning techniques to improve the detection and understanding of misinformation.\n    - **Temporal Analysis**: Introducing methods that not only consider the static features of misinformation but also analyze how its characteristics and spread change over time.\n    - **User Behavior Profiling**: Using advanced algorithms to create profiles of user behavior patterns that are more likely to engage with and spread misinformation, aiding in targeted interventions.\n\n4. **Validation and Testing**:\n    - **Cross-validation Techniques**: These methods would be employed to ensure that the models developed are robust and generalizable across different subsets of data.\n    - **Case Studies**: The methodology might also involve detailed case studies of specific misinformation events to illustrate the practical application of the proposed methods.\n\nIn summary, the proposed method or model for studying the linguistic underpinnings of misinformation on Twitter includes defining key terms, using a combination of linguistic, network, and content analysis, and leveraging innovative approaches like hybrid models and temporal analysis. Validation is achieved through robust testing and detailed case studies.",
