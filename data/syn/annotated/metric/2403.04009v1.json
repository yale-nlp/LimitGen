    "title": "Media Bias Matters: Understanding the Impact of Politically Biased News on Vaccine Attitudes in Social Media",
    "abstract": "News media has been utilized as a political tool to stray from facts, presenting biased claims without evidence. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, politically biased news (PBN) has significantly undermined public trust in vaccines, despite strong medical evidence supporting their efficacy. In this paper, we analyze: (i) how inherent vaccine stances subtly influence individuals\u2019 selection of news sources and participation in social media discussions; and (ii) the impact of exposure to PBN on users\u2019 attitudes toward vaccines. In doing so, we first curate a comprehensive dataset that connects PBN with related social media discourse. Utilizing advanced deep learning and causal inference techniques, we reveal distinct user behaviors between social media groups with various vaccine stances. Moreover, we observe that individuals with moderate stances, particularly the vaccine-hesitant majority, are more vulnerable to the influence of PBN compared to those with extreme views. Our findings provide critical insights to foster this line of research.",

            "text": "The pervasive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic transcends geographic and social boundaries Haleem et al. (2020  ###reference_b18###), having claimed over 7 million lives globally as of February 2024111https://covid19.who.int/  ###reference_covid19.who.int/###. Although vaccination emerges as the most efficacious defense, a substantial proportion of the population has shown vaccine hesitancy Dror et al. (2020  ###reference_b11###). A KFF survey Kirzinger et al. (2021  ###reference_b23###) reported that more than 40% of parents in the U.S. are hesitant to get their children vaccinated due to safety and efficacy concerns. Meanwhile, hundreds of mainstream media are responsible for publishing COVID-related politically biased news (PBN), turning the vaccine campaign into a political campaign Bolsen and Palm (2022  ###reference_b3###). While the skepticism around vaccines isn\u2019t new, when intertwined with news media, it exacerbates polarized opinions and conspiracy theories, thereby posing substantial challenges to public health efforts Sorell and Butler (2022  ###reference_b46###).\n\nRecent research has examined the impact of news coverage Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###), political polarization Ebeling et al. (2022  ###reference_b12###), and misinformation dissemination in social media Miyazaki et al. (2023  ###reference_b33###). However, few efforts have been focused on: (i) providing a comprehensive dataset that connects news media data with associated social media data; and (ii) understanding the causal relationship between exposure to PBN and people\u2019s vaccine stance changes. Most existing works Joseph et al. (2022  ###reference_b22###); Poddar et al. (2022  ###reference_b38###); Spiteri (2021  ###reference_b47###) studied their correlation instead of causation, the latter of which is the key to understanding the impact of a PBN intervention (i.e., reading a COVID-vaccine-related PBN) on the outcome (i.e., COVID-19 vaccine stance changes).\n\nWhile Fowler et al. (2022  ###reference_b14###) examined the causal relationship via surveys, it is limited to a small sample size and overlooks potential confounders such as user heterogeneity and social media features related to treatment and outcome. Modeling confounders is challenging due to the scarcity of observational data and domain knowledge. Moreover, little existing work differentiates the causal effect of groups with various vaccine stances. Large-scale studies on social media can complement prior research in the field to better understand how PBN shapes people\u2019s stances toward vaccines.\n\nTo address aforementioned limitations and challenges, we construct CovNS (Covid-19 biased News and Social media dataset), the first dataset which bridges the gap between COVID-related PBN and the corresponding social media discussions. Utilizing CovNS, we propose a research pipeline (see Figure 1  ###reference_###) to study the following research questions:\nRQ1: How do PBN consumption and social media discussion vary with different vaccine stance groups?\nRQ2: To what extent does PBN exposure contribute to the reversal and reinforcement of vaccine stances?\n\nIn summary, this study makes the following contributions to systematically address the posed research questions:\nDataset Curation: We build CovNS, the first dataset that establishes a connection between the COVID-related PBN and the social media data, enabling future research by providing sufficient annotations.\nBehavior Analysis: We characterize pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, and vaccine-hesitant groups on Twitter. We delve into the differences in PBN consumption preference and social media discussions across these groups.\nCausal Effect Estimation: We employ advanced causal learning methods to estimate the causal effect of reading PBN on users\u2019 vaccine stance changes.\n\nOur observations reveal that the three vaccine stance groups demonstrate significantly different user behaviors. Meanwhile, exposure to left-leaning and right-leaning news sources generally causes social media users to be more pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine, respectively. Notably, users who are hesitant about vaccination show a greater vulnerability to the influence of PBN, underscoring the significant challenges faced in promoting vaccination campaigns."

            "text": "Political bias in news media has been studied extensively in the areas of political science, social science, etc Eberl et al. (2017  ###reference_b13###). It is an inherent bias of journalists and media outlets that makes them intentionally report biased news articles in order to serve a political agenda. The alteration of the news content usually operates in two ways: (i) issue framing, i.e., presenting an issue in a way that will likely get the most agreement from supporters; and (ii) issue filtering, i.e., selectively omit information that supports an alternative opinion on the other political side Iyengar (1994  ###reference_b20###). As a result, readers were manipulated by misleading or false viewpoints and narratives. Prior work examining political bias using both qualitative and quantitative methods, has shown that U.S. news media differs ideologically and can create a highly polarized social environment Budak et al. (2016  ###reference_b4###). During the COVID-19 pandemic, much scholarly attention has been devoted to understanding the influence of PBN on public health. For example, some have shown that misleading information downplays the severity of COVID Teng et al. (2022  ###reference_b49###), false claims prevent people from knowing the fact Seo et al. (2022  ###reference_b43###), and conspiracy communities use PBN to distance users from science Sharma et al. (2022  ###reference_b44###)."

Among them, some works contributed to providing labeled datasets regarding COVID-19 vaccine stance Mu et al. (2023); Glandt et al. (2021). These works use either manual or algorithmic annotations to label a post as anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, or vaccine-hesitant. There exist other works that focus on building machine learning models to predict the COVID-19 vaccine stance, using linguistic features Poddar et al. (2022), auxiliary information Tahir et al. (2022), or large language models Riaz et al. (2022). Besides, another line of research has been devoted to collecting COVID-vaccine-related datasets from news media. Semeraro et al. (2022) collected 5,745 news from 17 Italian news media. Joseph et al. (2022) collected 750k articles from over 300 local news outlets to analyze relations between news coverage and offline behaviors. However, little prior work provided labeled datasets of COVID-vaccine-related PBN and social media discussion. To bridge this gap, our dataset combines both social media (e.g., tweets) and news media (e.g., news articles) data with multi-level manual and algorithmic annotations on news articles, posts, and users."

We then annotate the vaccine stances for the collected data using manual and algorithmic labeling strategies. At last, we apply filters to compose a high-quality dataset for our experiment. Table 1 provides an overview of CovNS.\n\nWe gather COVID-related PBN from Allsides, a website that assesses the political bias of prominent media outlets, and presents different versions of similar news stories from sources of the political right, left, and center. It shows readers news coverage and diverse perspectives from all across the American political spectrum. In addition, it also provides a neutral summary to recapitulate the story and discuss how different news outlets spin or manipulate the facts. Note that Allsides currently only focuses on English news from American media outlets.\n\nFor each news story, we collect the triplets of PBN denoting news articles from left-leaning, center-leaning, and right-leaning news media, respectively. They are associated with corresponding titles, contents, and URLs. We also collect meta-information such as publication date, topics, media name, and URLs of banners or pictures for each news article.

            "text": "Two sets of labels are essential to analyze the relationship between PBN consumption and vaccine stance changes of social media users: political leaning and vaccine stance. We adopt labels on political leaning (left, lean-left, center, lean-right, or right) from Allsides. For each news article, the rating process includes (i) editorial review, (ii) blind bias survey, (iii) independent review, (iv) third-party review, (v) community feedback, and (vi) confidence level. \n\nHowever, both data sources (Allsides and Twitter) do not provide human-annotated labels on COVID-19 vaccine stances. As it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task to annotate vaccine stances for the entire collected dataset with 2,196 news articles and 243,412,961 tweets, we follow the method mentioned in Lyu et al. (2022) and leverage a human-in-the-loop machine-learning strategy to minimize the manual annotation effort meanwhile maintaining high-quality labels. Specifically, we first identify common COVID-related keywords (covid, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2) to filter out news articles and tweets unrelated to COVID-19. After that, we invite two annotators in the area to inspect the headline and content to assign one of the four labels for each news article:\n\nPro-vaccine, i.e., news that promotes the willingness of vaccine acceptance and uptake;  \nAnti-vaccine, i.e., news that discourages the willingness of vaccine acceptance and uptake;  \nMixed, i.e., news that contains controversial opinions about COVID-19 vaccines; and  \nOther, i.e., news that contains general COVID-19 information, but are unrelated to vaccines.  \n\nBefore annotating, we inform the annotators of a few examples of each category. To further obtain the ground truth, we only considered the annotations that both annotators agreed on. This results in 410 pro-vaccine, 395 anti-vaccine, 409 mixed, and 772 other news articles.  \n\nFor our large-scale Twitter dataset, we finetune a pre-trained CT-BERT on three publicly available Twitter datasets for COVID-19 vaccine stance detection. The final downstream task is designed to be a binary classification, i.e., infer the stance of COVID-vaccine-related tweets as pro-vaccine (+1) or anti-vaccine (-1). Our final model achieves a high F1 score and accuracy, yielding respectively 0.833 and 0.845. To further evaluate our dataset\u2019s final model, we adopt a set of COVID-vaccine-stance-related keywords from CoVaxxy to extract relevant tweets. Then we manually check the machine-generated stance labels. Specifically, we randomly select 500 COVID-vaccine-related tweets (250 pro-vaccine and 250 anti-vaccine) from our dataset and manually annotate them. This suggests that the final model is capable and reliable in labeling the rest COVID-vaccine-related tweets in our dataset."

            "text": "People with different vaccine stances can have different news consumption behaviors, e.g., pro-vaxxers read more news from the left-leaning media. How they react to a PBN reading intervention may also differ significantly. Therefore, it is critical to identify groups with different vaccine stances to mitigate potential selection and sampling bias. In this section, we (i) categorize users into anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and vaccine-hesitant groups and then (ii) compare their PBN consumption behaviors and social media discussions.\nBased on a study from the SAGE working group MacDonald and others (2015  ###reference_b28###), vaccine hesitancy occurs on the continuum between two extremes, i.e., completely accepting (pro-vaccine) and refusing all vaccines (anti-vaccine). Intuitively, vaccine-hesitant users change their stances more frequently compared to anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers. Therefore, we first calculate the monthly COVID-vaccine stance changes:\nNote that  and  denote the number of pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine tweets before a user reads PBN, respectively. Similar to Mitra et al. (2016  ###reference_b32###), we then determine three types of vaccine stance groups based on the following criteria:\npro-vaccine group, users whose monthly COVID-19 vaccine  are always greater than 0.8;\nanti-vaccine group, users whose monthly COVID-19 vaccine  are always less than -0.8; and\nvaccine-hesitant group, users whose monthly COVID-19 vaccine  are changing between 0.8 and -0.8.\nIn total, we identify 2,377 pro-vaccine, 1,238 anti-vaccine, and 10,428 vaccine-hesitant users.\nNext, we compare the selection bias of three types of news sources in the pro-vaccine group, anti-vaccine group, and vaccine-hesitant group in Figure 3  ###reference_###. A notable observation is that the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine groups display a highly unbalanced distribution compared to the vaccine-hesitant group. Left-leaning and right-leaning news dominate among the pro-vaccine (around 75%) and anti-vaccine groups (around 91%), respectively. Meanwhile, users in the vaccine-hesitant group read news mainly from center-leaning (around 43%) and left-leaning (around 35%) media outlets.\n###figure_3### We further use topic modeling on the collected COVID-vaccine-related tweets to investigate topics each group is interested in after reading PBN. The text is pre-processed by punctuation removal, URL removal, stop words removal, hashtag removal, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. The cleaned data is then fed into BERTopic Grootendorst (2022  ###reference_b16###), a state-of-the-art topic modeling technique that leverages Sentence-Bert (SBERT) Reimers and Gurevych (2019  ###reference_b39###) for text embedding, UMAP McInnes et al. (2018  ###reference_b30###) for dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN McInnes et al. (2017  ###reference_b29###) for clustering, and a class-based TF-IDF for topic representation. To verify the quality of the result from BERTopic, we manually inspect representative tweets (i.e., tweets nearest to the cluster centroid) for each topic cluster. Finally, we merge over-partitioned clusters to obtain the final list of COVID-related topic clusters.\nVaccine Refusal\ndie, kill, serious, allergic, side, effect, risk, freedom\nI won\u2019t EVER comply. #NOmasks #NOVaccine.

            "text": "One of the primary challenges in causal effect estimation with observational data is controlling for confounders. In this research question, we (i) identify two types of social media features as potential confounders: users\u2019 statistical profile feature (e.g., number of tweets) and textual content feature (e.g., historical tweets) Veitch et al. (2020  ###reference_b50###); Cheng et al. (2022a  ###reference_b5###). With the identified potential confounders, we (i) estimate the causal effect of reading COVID-vaccine-related PBN on Twitter users\u2019 vaccine stance changes. We hypothesize that reading COVID-vaccine-related news from left-leaning and right-leaning media will cause people\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine stance to shift toward pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine, respectively. To validate this hypothesis, we begin by formulating the problem as a causal effect estimation task. We use causal graphs  Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###) to represent the two scenarios we consider \u2013 (1) when the causal effect is confounded only by observed variables (see Figure 4(a)  ###reference_sf1###); and (2) when there exist unobserved confounders (see Figure 4(b)  ###reference_sf2###). With them, we apply state-of-the-art causal learning methods to quantitatively estimate the causal effect using data from CovNS. We also compare the results obtained by the causal learning models and that from a correlation-based model.\nWe consider the following profile features as potential confounders:\nThe log-transformed number of historical tweets, likes, followers, and friends;\nThe 2020 U.S. presidential election results of the location, ( blue state,  red state);\nThe age (months) of the account;\nThe Twitter account is verified or not, ( unverified,  verified); and\nThe proportion of COVID-vaccine-related tweets, i.e., a continuum between 0 and 1.\nFor the textual feature, we extract the text embedding of the most recent one-week historical tweets before a user reads PBN from the fine-tuned CT-BERT. These statistical and textual features can reflect user characteristics, which are related to users\u2019 online behaviors. Therefore, we select these important social media features as potential confounders for discovering the causal relation in the next phase.\nWe define the causal effect we aim to estimate \u2013 reading COVID-vaccine-related PBN (treatment) denoted by  on one\u2019s COVID-vaccine stance shifting (outcome) denoted by . We represent the causal relations among variables with two different causal graphs Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###) to consider two possible scenarios (see Figure 5  ###reference_###).\nWe consider four different settings in terms of how the values of  and  are defined (see Table 3  ###reference_###).\nThen, with -calculus Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###), we define the causal estimand, i.e., the average treatment effect (ATE):\nwhere  is the expectation of  when  is intervened to take value .\nAs aforementioned, we consider the user characteristics, i.e., a set of selected profile features and user history, are related to one\u2019s PBN consumption behavior () and change in COVID-19 vaccine stance ().\nIn scenario 1, we let the confounder  be these user characteristics. Thus, by conditioning on them, we can block the backdoor path (treatment-confounder-outcome) to handle confounding bias.\nWith Figure 4(a)  ###reference_sf1###, we assume that there is no backdoor path between  and  by conditioning on the observed user characteristics . This leads to the identification of ATE through backdoor criterion Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###):\nIn this scenario, we estimate ATE with two state-of-the-art causal learning methods. Double machine learning (DML) Chernozhukov et al. (2018  ###reference_b7###) \u2013 DML estimates heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data with machine learning algorithms. It contains two predictive tasks (i.e., predict the treatment and outcome from the confounder) to ensure unbiased estimates of the causal effect. We use a linear DML in this study.\nCausal Forest (CF) Athey et al. (2019  ###reference_b1###) \u2013 CF is widely adopted for causal effect estimation, which performs recursive partition in the confounder space s.t. each leaf of a tree in CF corresponds to a homogeneous subpopulation with similar causal effect.\nCompared to linear DML, CF models the relationship between the confounder and the treatment with a tree-based model and infers the causal effect of a test instance by looking up the treatment effect of the subpopulation this instance is mapped to.\nScenario 1 relies on a strong causal assumption that all confounders are observable/measurable (i.e., the unconfoundedness assumption Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###)). However, in practice, some confounders are hidden or unmeasurable. For example, one\u2019s education and occupation may not be explicitly stated in the user profile. We cannot hope to measure all possible confounders. A common practice is to adopt the \u201cproxy variables\u201d Cheng et al. (2022b  ###reference_b6###). For example, some textual clues from historical tweets can implicitly reflect users\u2019 education levels and jobs. Therefore, in scenario 2, we further relax the unconfoundedness assumption and consider the observed user characteristics  as the proxies of the latent confounder . The causal graph is illustrated in Figure 4(b)  ###reference_sf2###. Then we can leverage proximal causal inference methods Miao et al. (2018  ###reference_b31###) to identify ATE.\nSpecifically, we consider Causal effect variational autoencoder\n(CEVAE) Louizos et al. (2017  ###reference_b25###) as the estimator. CEVAE leverages deep variational autoencoders (VAE) to learn the representation of the latent confounder given the observed proxy variables.\nFor comparison, we include a correlation-based method. Specifically, we implement a simple logistic regression on treatment that predicts the outcome  with the treatment  as its input. It can be considered as a generalized version of the naive estimator Rubin (1978  ###reference_b41###) that does not control the effect of confounding variables.\n###figure_6### ###figure_7### ###figure_8### ###figure_9### ###figure_10### ###figure_11### Figure 6  ###reference_### shows the comparison of the overall estimated ATE by different methods and that of the pro-vaccine group (5(b)  ###reference_sf2###), anti-vaccine group (5(c)  ###reference_sf3###), and vaccine-hesitant group (5(d)  ###reference_sf4###). The estimated ATE from DML, CF, and CEVAE are similar ().\nComparing the results from settings 1 and 2, we observe that reading PBN from left-leaning media causes individuals to be more pro-vaccine. In contrast, results from settings 3 and 4 show that consuming PBN from right-leaning media causes people to be more anti-vaccine.\nResults from logistic regression (LR) on treatment are outliers in all experiments (). For example, the estimated ATEs of LR in setting 3 show that reading right-leaning PBN will make people more pro-vaccine, which is opposite to the results from causal learning models. A possible explanation is that the results of correlation-based observational studies usually suffer from spurious correlation due to confounding bias, especially when the confounding effect is important Austin (2011  ###reference_b2###).\nIn addition, we find that the magnitudes of the estimated ATE of the vaccine-hesitant group are higher than the pro-vaccine group and anti-vaccine group, indicating that vaccine-hesitant people are more likely to change their vaccine stances after consuming PBN."

            "text": "RQ1. Users with varying stances on vaccines display unique patterns of PBN consumption and social media discussion. Future research should consider the disparity when studying vaccine-related problems in social media.\nCompared to the vaccine-hesitant people, the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine group members are more likely to read PBN from far-left and far-right news media, respectively. Intensive exposure to highly biased news may explain the occurrence of extreme COVID-19 vaccine stances.\nAs \u201cscientific arguments\u201d and \u201cpolitical narratives\u201d usually contain debatable opinions, the vaccine-hesitant group member is able to gather diverse information from both sides. Thus, their stances may move back and forth.\nThe pattern of increasing interest in \u201cvaccine acceptance\u201d and a decline in \u201cvaccine refusal\u201d indicates that the vaccine-hesitant group is becoming more positive about the vaccine.\nRQ2. The exposure to COVID-vaccine-related news from left- and right-leaning media causes one\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine stance shift toward pro- and anti-vaccine respectively, especially for users in the vaccine-hesitant group. This suggests that it is possible for malicious people to manipulate public opinion through PBN interventions.\nThe similar estimated causal effects from causal learning models indicate that the unobserved confounding variables may have limited impacts on the treatment and outcome.\nComparing the magnitudes of the estimated ATE (see Figure 5(a)  ###reference_sf1###), we observe that left-leaning news (setting 1 and 2) is more influential than right-leaning news (setting 3 and 4). We speculate that vaccine-hesitant people are more likely to become pro-vaxxers than anti-vaxxers over time through the influence of PBN.\nAs reading left-leaning news has a very small causal effect (around ) on anti-vaxxers\u2019 vaccine stance changes (see Figure 5(c)  ###reference_sf3###), it is unlikely to alter anti-vaxxers to pro-vaxxers through PBN reading interventions. Meanwhile, pro-vaxxers are difficult to become anti-vaxxers by consuming PBN (see Figure 5(b)  ###reference_sf2###). This indicates that people with extreme views about vaccines tend to reinforce their existing stances. On the other hand, the vaccine-hesitant majority are vulnerable to the influence of PBN and, thus, may frequently reverse their minds."

            "text": "This paper investigates the impact of PBN consumption on the vaccine stance changes of social media users. We construct CovNS, which contains data from both news media and social media. We compare the PBN consumption behavior and social media discussion between three vaccine stance groups. By identifying potential confounders, we leverage state-of-the-art causal inference methods to estimate the causal effect. Our experiments and analyses have implications for fostering the research of vaccine hesitancy in social media. We conclude that consuming left-leaning and right-leaning news causes people to be pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine, respectively. More importantly, there is only a small possibility for anti-vaxxers to become pro-vaxxers via PBN reading interventions on social media, and vice versa."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe paper is motivated by the pervasive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued to claim millions of lives globally. Despite the availability of vaccines as the most effective defense against the virus, a significant portion of the population exhibits vaccine hesitancy. The study underscores the pivotal role that politically biased news (PBN) in mainstream media plays in shaping public attitudes towards vaccination, particularly in the socio-political context of the U.S. The intertwinement of vaccine information with political bias exacerbates polarized opinions and conspiracy theories, posing substantial challenges to public health efforts.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe central research problem addressed in this study is the lack of comprehensive data and understanding of the causal relationship between exposure to politically biased news and changes in people's vaccine stances. Previous research has largely focused on correlations rather than causation, limiting the understanding of how PBN influences vaccine attitudes. Additionally, existing surveys have limitations, such as small sample sizes and the overlooking of potential confounders like user heterogeneity and social media features. There is a need to differentiate the causal effects across various vaccine stance groups and to complement prior research with large-scale social media studies.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Impact of News Coverage**: Research such as Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. (2022) has examined the impact of news coverage, highlighting the broader context of media influence.\n   \n2. **Political Polarization**: Studies like Ebeling et al. (2022) explored political polarization, which is critical in understanding the backdrop against which PBN operates.\n   \n3. **Misinformation Dissemination**: Miyazaki et al. (2023) focused on misinformation dissemination in social media, an essential factor in discussing media bias and its effects.\n\n4. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Most existing works, including Joseph et al. (2022), Poddar et al. (2022), and Spiteri (2021), studied correlations rather than causation between media consumption and vaccine attitudes.\n\n5. **Causal Relationship via Surveys**: Fowler et al. (2022) examined causal relationships through surveys but were hindered by small sample sizes and unaddressed confounders.\n\nThis paper aims to address these gaps by constructing the CovNS dataset, bridging the gap between COVID-related PBN and corresponding social media discussions, and proposing a research pipeline to analyze the causal effects of PBN exposure on vaccine stance changes across different user groups.",
        "methodology": "The methodology of the paper \"Media Bias Matters: Understanding the Impact of Politically Biased News on Vaccine Attitudes in Social Media\" outlines a detailed process for constructing a comprehensive dataset to study the influence of politically biased news (PBN) on vaccine attitudes. The key components and innovations of the proposed method are as follows:\n\n1. **Data Collection Sources**: \n   - **Allsides**: This website assesses the political bias of media outlets and provides news articles from different political perspectives (left-leaning, center-leaning, and right-leaning). Allsides not only presents diverse perspectives but also offers a neutral summary to highlight how various outlets might spin or present the facts.\n   - **Twitter**: Leveraging the official academic research API, the authors gather social media data related to the collected PBN.\n\n2. **Types of Data Collected**:\n   - **News Articles**: For each news story, a triplet of news articles from the left, center, and right political spectra is collected. This includes the article's title, content, and URL. Additional metadata such as publication date, topics, media name, and URLs for images or banners is also included.\n   - **Social Media Content**: Using the URLs of PBN articles, the researchers retrieve related tweets, retweets, and replies from Twitter. They also gather historical tweets and profile information from users who have engaged in discussions about COVID-related PBN.\n\n3. **Annotation Process**:\n   - **Human-Annotated Labels**: Political leanings for collected news articles are gathered from Allsides.\n   - **Vaccine Stance Annotation**: Both manual and algorithmic labeling strategies are employed to annotate the vaccine stances found in the collected data.\n\n4. **Dataset Filtering**:\n   - After the initial collection and annotation, filters are applied to ensure the quality of the final dataset, making it suitable for the experiments and analyses.\n\n5. **Dataset Overview**:\n   - The dataset consists of 732 COVID-related news triplets (totaling 2,196 news articles) from 160 U.S. media outlets.\n   - The social media component includes 243,412,961 historical tweets from 36,172 unique Twitter accounts.\n\nIn summary, the proposed methodology combines diverse and balanced news articles from Allsides with extensive Twitter data. The dual annotation process ensures the dataset is rich in information about both political bias and vaccine stances. This dataset serves as a robust foundation for examining the impact of politically biased news on vaccine attitudes within social media.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup:**\n\n1. **User Categorization**: \n   - Users are categorized into three groups based on their vaccine stances: pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, and vaccine-hesitant. This categorization is performed by analyzing monthly stances using the proportion of pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine tweets.\n   - Criteria for categorization:\n     - Pro-vaccine group: Users with monthly COVID-19 vaccine stance \\( > 0.8 \\)\n     - Anti-vaccine group: Users with monthly COVID-19 vaccine stance \\( < -0.8 \\)\n     - Vaccine-hesitant group: Users with monthly COVID-19 vaccine stance fluctuating between 0.8 and -0.8\n   - Outcome: 2,377 pro-vaccine users, 1,238 anti-vaccine users, and 10,428 vaccine-hesitant users.\n\n2. **Comparison of PBN Consumption Behaviors**:\n   - The study compares the selection bias of three types of news sources (left-leaning, right-leaning, and center-leaning) among the three user groups.\n   - Observations:\n     - Pro-vaccine group: Predominantly consumes left-leaning news (around 75%).\n     - Anti-vaccine group: Predominantly consumes right-leaning news (around 91%).\n     - Vaccine-hesitant group: Consumes a mix, with center-leaning (around 43%) and left-leaning (around 35%) news sources.\n\n3. **Topic Modeling on Social Media Discussions**:\n   - Utilized BERTopic for topic modeling on collected COVID-vaccine-related tweets post PBN reading.\n   - Preprocessing steps include punctuation removal, URL removal, stop words removal, hashtag removal, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.\n   - Topics identified through BERTopic:\n     - **Vaccine Refusal**: Keywords like die, kill, serious, allergic, side, effect, risk, freedom.\n     - **Vaccine Acceptance**: Keywords like boost, cdc, fight, child, protect, strong, together, immunity.\n     - **Conspiracy Theory**: Keywords like fauci, bill, gates, chip, track, lie, kill, bio, weapon, lab, leak.\n     - **Scientific Argument**: Keywords like cell, mrna, evidence, study, immunity, doctor, symptom.\n     - **Political Narrative**: Keywords like trump, biden, plan, fund, mayor, congress, campaign.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics**:\n- **Topic Distribution**: The proportion of tweets corresponding to each identified topic across different stance groups.\n- **Temporal Trends**: Changes in the frequency of discussions around identified topics over time.\n\n**Main Experimental Results**:\n1. **Topic Preference Across Groups**:\n   - Pro-vaccine group: Majority discuss \u201cvaccine acceptance\u201d (46.5%) and \u201cscientific argument\u201d (23.3%).\n   - Anti-vaccine group: Majority discuss \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d (42.4%) and \u201cvaccine refusal\u201d (35.6%).\n   - Vaccine-hesitant group: Inclined towards \u201cscientific arguments\u201d (36.0%) and \u201cpolitical narratives\u201d (28.8%).\n\n2. **Temporal Dynamics**:\n   - Discussions about \u201cvaccine acceptance\u201d (green) and \u201cscientific argument\u201d (blue) have steadily grown in pro-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant groups.\n   - \u201cConspiracy theories\u201d (purple) and \u201cvaccine refusal\u201d (red) show a rapid increase between April 2022 and May 2022 in the anti-vaccine group.\n   - \u201cPolitical discussion\u201d (grey) trends similarly across all three groups.\n\nThe results provide insights into how different stance groups consume politically biased news and how this affects their discussions on social media."

            "experiment_process": "Researchers first categorized users into anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and vaccine-hesitant groups based on their social media posts using the monthly change in the stance as a criterion. They identified 2,377 pro-vaccine, 1,238 anti-vaccine, and 10,428 vaccine-hesitant users. Using topic modeling techniques such as BERTopic, the researchers investigated the topics of interest for each group after they had read PBN, by pre-processing tweets and extracting major topics. The results of the topic modeling were then manually inspected and clusters were merged to identify the final list of topics.",
            "result_discussion": "The findings show distinct news consumption behaviors and discussion topics for each group. The pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine groups primarily consume left-leaning and right-leaning news, respectively, while vaccine-hesitant users tend toward center-leaning and left-leaning media. In terms of discussion topics, the pro-vaccine group focuses on 'vaccine acceptance' and 'scientific argument,' the anti-vaccine group on 'conspiracy theories' and 'vaccine refusal,' and the vaccine-hesitant group on 'scientific arguments' and 'political narratives.' Over time, the pro-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant groups showed steady growth in discussions about 'vaccine acceptance' and 'scientific arguments,' while the anti-vaccine group increasingly discussed 'conspiracy theories' and 'vaccine refusal.'",

            "research_objective": "To estimate the causal effect of reading politically biased news (PBN) on Twitter users' vaccine stance changes and to validate the hypothesis that left-leaning and right-leaning PBN cause shifts toward pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine stances, respectively.",
            "experiment_process": "The study identified potential confounders such as users' statistical profile features and textual content features. Using causal graphs, the researchers considered two scenarios: confounding by observed variables only, and confounding by both observed and unobserved variables. They applied various causal learning methods to estimate the effect of reading COVID-vaccine-related PBN on stance changes. They used Double Machine Learning (DML), Causal Forest (CF), and Causal Effect Variational Autoencoder (CEVAE) for the analysis. The results from these methods were compared with those from a correlation-based model to examine the consistency and reliability.",
            "result_discussion": "The results from DML, CF, and CEVAE methods were consistent and indicated that reading PBN from left-leaning media makes individuals more pro-vaccine, while consuming right-leaning PBN makes individuals more anti-vaccine. The correlation-based logistic regression method produced outlier results that often contradicted findings from the causal learning models, suggesting issues with spurious correlations. The study also found that vaccine-hesitant individuals are more susceptible to changes in their vaccine stance after consuming PBN compared to pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine groups.",
