    "abstract": "Current work in language models (LMs) helps us speed up or even skip thinking by accelerating and automating cognitive work. But can LMs help us with critical thinking \u2013 thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts? We treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs. Using our findings, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. We hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other \u2018critical thinkers\u2019 to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs.",

            "text": "Language Models (LMs) have recently alleviated a whole host of our intellectual inconveniences. They can help us do things we would have begrudgingly done by ourselves otherwise: write code, generate emails, and translate text. In sparking ideas by generating stories and concept designs, LMs offer shortcuts to gaining new thoughts. They also help us put our thinking into words by revising and giving feedback on our writing. In all these cases, LMs help us speed up and circumvent the inconveniences of thinking ourselves.\n\nIn many contexts, however, the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of thinking is not a temporary problem to be alleviated, but a deep puzzle to be reflected upon. Many people are invested in specific areas of intellectual inquiry \u2013 e.g., historians, scientists, philosophers \u2013 and more generally, in reflection and engagement with the world \u2013 e.g., as informed political citizens, critical consumers of media, and moral actors. They are interested in identifying and challenging assumptions, clarifying muddled ideas, and engineering new and useful ways to think. Core to this sort of inquiry is critical thinking \u2013 \u201cthe propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism.\u201d\n\nCan LMs serve as tools for critical thinking \u2013 helping us think more deeply and in more complex ways, rather than faster or not at all?\n\nTo investigate how LMs can serve as critical thinking tools, we use philosophers as a case study \u2013 philosophers being people who are in the business of thinking critically about a wide range of concepts and ideas. We interview 21 professional philosophers to understand their thinking processes, collect their experiences with and views on current LMs, and brainstorm the roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools in philosophy.\n\nWe find that current philosophers do not think LMs are good critical thinking tools for two primary reasons: LMs are too neutral, detached, and nonjudgmental; and LMs are too servile, passive, and incurious. We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, which explains why philosophers find conversations with other philosophers and reading philosophical texts to be more helpful for their work than current LMs. Using the model, we describe three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. Finally, we outline how these LMs could inform metaphilosophical questions and shape the discipline of philosophy, and discuss challenges in building LMs and interfaces for critical thinking."

            "text": "A large and growing literature investigates how LMs can serve as thinking tools for humans engaged in intellectual work. This research tends to concern how LMs can serve two intellectual functions: idea stimulation and idea expression. LMs can provide stimulus for ideas \u2013 information and formulations which provoke and guide creative processes. In these roles, LMs expand the set of ideas available, which can become inspiration for thinking. These LMs may continue to provide stimulus while engaging in the process. For instance, LMs can produce creative analogies, metaphors, and \u2018sparks\u2019 to stimulate serious thinking. Existing pools of ideas might be expanded with LMs. Creative writers may use LMs to propose plots, characters, and entire stories; designers may use LMs to generate concept designs; scientists may use LMs to find literature and (re)formulate problems in novel ways.\n\nOn the other hand, LMs can also aid the expression of ideas (in language). It is assumed that there is an idea in mind and LMs can be used to find the formulation which best represents it. LMs can help \u2018translate ideas into words\u2019 by making suggested revisions and helping clarify writing goals. Writing feedback given by LMs may be more useful, more motivating, and more engaging than feedback given by other humans."

            "text": "One part of the thinking process is clearly missing. One does not simply go from the stimulus for an idea to figuring out how to express the idea: critical thinking involves reflection upon ideas, judgment, and conceptual engineering. Language Models (LMs) can help provide the seeds for our ideas when we don\u2019t have any (i.e., stimulus) and help us formulate them once we\u2019ve got them (i.e., expression), but how can they help us with questioning, reorienting, analyzing, and developing ideas (i.e., critical thinking)? There are many different definitions of critical thinking: \u201cthe propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism\u201d (McPeck, 2016), \u201creasonable, reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do\u201d (Ennis, 1993), and \u201cthe development and evaluation of arguments\u201d (Facione, 1984). Critical thinking requires many dispositions, such as seeking clear statements of questions, looking for alternatives, and being open-minded (Ennis, 1987).\n\nCritical thinking is what makes many areas of intellectual inquiry \u2013 such as history, science, and philosophy \u2013 difficult. For instance, on different accounts, history requires interpreting the past with alternative (nonlinear, long-range) temporalities (Braudel, 2023), taking into account the ways in which power structures shape historical record (Foucault, 1995; Trouillot, 1995), and identifying and manipulating narrative structures (White, 1975; Gaddis, 2004). Science requires advances not only in empirical work, but also in the underlying paradigms of research (Kuhn & Hawkins, 1963) and navigation of a variety of social, technical, and material factors (Latour, 1989).\n\nA limited body of work has explored how LMs might contribute towards human critical thinking. Cai et al. (2024) consider how currently \u201csycophantic,\u201d \u201cservile,\u201d and \u201clobotomized\u201d LMs can be used in more critical ways by challenging users\u2019 pre-existing ideas and constructively using antagonistic interactions to develop their thinking. Park & Kulkarni (2024) show how LMs as \u201cthinking assistants\u201d can facilitate human reflection by asking, instead of answering, questions."

            "text": "In this paper, we focus on philosophy as a case study for critical thinking. Philosophy is concerned with critical, systematic, and reflective examination of the world. This includes understanding the basic structure of life and the world \u2013 what does it mean to exist (Aristotle, 1908; Heidegger, 1962; Sartre, 1993), live (Aurelius, 2006), and die (Kierkegaard, 1983; Nietzsche, 1961); what does it mean to know something (Plato, 2008b; Kant, 2003; Husserl, 1977) and what are the limits of scientific knowledge (Popper, 2002; Chalmers, 2013); on what moral bases should we act (Aristotle, 2004; Spinoza, 2003), and is it even possible to determine \u2018objective\u2019 answers to moral questions (Hume, 2003; Harman & Thomson, 1996)? Core to philosophy is \u201cthe endeavour to know how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead of legitimating what is already known\u201d (Foucault & Hurley, 1990). In thinking about how to think, philosophy is not only about suspicion toward the meanings and functions of various phenomena, but also recovery of new significances, meanings, and coherence (Ricoeur & Thompson, 1981). Contrary to the image that philosophy is \u201cdone in the armchair\u201d, isolated and impractical, philosophy has always been intertwined with other lines of inquiry. Plato engaged extensively with advanced mathematics; Aristotle contributed to early physics; Hume leaned on psychology. Philosophy has asked and continues to ask urgent, relevant questions: how are we to understand \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d in algorithmic discrimination (Hu, 2023), legal punishment (Alexander, 1922), and the distribution of resources (Rawls, 1971); quantum mechanics in physics (Carnap, 1966); the relationship between consciousness and the brain in neuroscience (Chalmers, 2013)? Indeed, researchers in every area of intellectual inquiry confront philosophical questions in their work: they might ask if a model or concept is \u201creally real\u201d and how they know so, or aim to formulate normative desiderata for theories."

High-direction resources are not strictly or existentially bound to their user\u2019s directives, and may deviate from them. Current LMs exhibit low initiative (\u00a74.3). \n\nThese two axes form the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, and explain why philosophers find texts and other people (but not LMs) to be useful tools. Our model further provides a design space for LMs as critical thinking tools. \n\n###figure_1### Why do philosophers find other people and texts to be useful critical thinking tools? In the selfhood-initiative model, other people are variable-initiative tools. People have specific backgrounds and experiences which inform their views, perspectives, and beliefs; these influence how they understand and respond. Philosophers find value in talking to other people; they expect that they will receive interesting judgements and comments, rather than placid neutrality. However, these people may have variable initiative, depending on the situation. In free-flowing conversation, each interlocutor may carry the conversation in some direction, whereas in a more focused conversation aimed at collecting feedback, an interlocutor may be expected to directly respond to one\u2019s ideas and requests without their own intellectual initiative. \n\nMeanwhile, in the selfhood-initiative model, texts are high-initiative, variable-selfhood tools. Texts are not themselves responsive to a user\u2019s intentions (Plato, 2008a); they express the author\u2019s attempt to fulfill their intentions, and one encounters the product of this attempt after the fact of its production. This exteriority from the user allows the user to reflect upon similarities and differences between their own thinking and the tool\u2019s outputs. On the other hand, the way in which texts are written can vary in the degree of selfhood they express. \n\nInformative, survey-based, and clarificatory papers tend to de-emphasize an author\u2019s perspectives and opinions, whereas more explicitly argumentative papers may center them; both can be useful to philosophers in different ways. \n\nWhy don\u2019t philosophers find current LMs to be useful critical thinking tools? In the selfhood-initiative model, current LMs are low-selfhood, low-initiative tools. They do not provide philosophers with particular concrete perspectives into the problem space, nor do they provide ideas sufficiently exterior to a philosopher\u2019s own thinking to allow for meaningful reflection and connections. These properties make LMs particularly useful for alternative modes of thought, such as carrying out rote and well-defined tasks and helping rewrite sentences, but hamper critical thinking."

            "text": "Philosophers mention that they often get their ideas in free-flowing conversation with fellow philosophers or from reading literature making arguments which seem tenuous, incorrect, or incomplete. As a role for LMs, this would involve making judgments and taking positions based on its perspectives. It would challenge or disagree with what users say and respond or modify its beliefs if users make reasonable points. It would ask its own questions in pursuit of its interests, and refuse or redirect certain lines of inquiry in favor of others. Drawing upon persistent memories and beliefs across sessions to produce ideas, it might be charitable and polite, like colleagues, while resisting a servile and sycophantic dynamic. \n\nWhen developing ideas, philosophers encounter various decision points at which they use certain approaches over others. Many suggest it is important to become more aware of the choices at these decision points. Without such awareness, philosophers expose their ideas to imprecision and objections, potentially reproducing biases and metaphilosophical problems. As a role for LMs, it would act as a \u201cchecks and balances\u201d on philosophizing, providing a variety of ideas and resources. It functions similarly to survey texts, illustrating different approaches and helping philosophers situate their ideas. Its suggestions may or may not be directly relevant but act as guides. It may ask methodological questions aimed at clarifying philosophers\u2019 decisions.\n\nAs philosophers develop their ideas, they want to understand how others might react, gaining insight into possible misinterpretations, objections, and clarification questions. Interactions can inform how philosophers formulate and present ideas, anticipating objections and strengthening the appeal and utility of their work. It can be counterfactually helpful: if an agent representing an unsavory position resonates with a philosopher\u2019s argument, it might lead the philosopher to reconsider expression, not only defending but delimiting the argument's scope."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation, Research Problem, and Relevant Prior Work\n\n**Motivation:**\nThe paper is driven by a deep-seated curiosity about whether Language Models (LMs), which have become prolific tools in assisting various intellectual and creative tasks, can be leveraged as tools for critical thinking. The premise anchors on the juxtaposition of current LMs\u2019 capabilities, which primarily alleviate intellectual inconveniences, and the more profound necessity of fostering deep, reflective, and skeptical thinking \u2013 characteristics central to disciplines such as philosophy. By examining the potential of LMs beyond their conventional uses, the paper aims to explore the realm where these models can aid in complex intellectual engagements rather than just speeding up cognitive processes or bypassing them entirely.\n\n**Research Problem:**\nThe main research problem is to evaluate whether current Language Models can serve as effective tools for critical thinking, particularly within the domain of philosophy. This involves understanding how LMs align or misalign with the critical thinking processes of philosophers, identifying limitations in current LMs when it comes to engaging in deep intellectual discourse, and proposing models that could enhance their functionality as critical thinking aids. Specifically, the investigation seeks to explore:\n1. The current views and experiences of professional philosophers regarding LMs.\n2. The reasons why philosophers find current LMs inadequate for critical thinking.\n3. Potential roles that LMs could play to better support critical thinking in philosophical inquiry.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\n1. **Code Writing and Text Generation:** Previous studies have shown that LMs can assist in writing code (Chen et al., 2021; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2024) and generating emails (Goodman et al., 2022) as well as translating texts (Costa-juss\u00e0 et al., 2022).\n2. **Creativity and Idea Spark:** LMs have been used to generate stories (Schwitzgebel et al., 2023) and concept designs (Ma et al., 2023), showcasing their potential in sparking new ideas and thoughts.\n3. **Writing Assistance:** LMs also aid in putting thoughts into words by revising writing (Mysore et al., 2023) and providing feedback (Liang et al., 2023).\n4. **Critical Thinking:** The concept of critical thinking, defined as \u201cthe propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism\u201d (McPeck, 2016), forms the theoretical underpinning of this study. The authors connect this notion with the philosophical practice of thinking deeply and critically about various concepts and ideas.\n\nThrough these foundational works, the paper situates its investigation within the broader context of how LMs currently function and their potential evolution to support deeper intellectual activities.",
        "methodology": "The methodology for the study \"Language Models as Critical Thinking Tools: A Case Study of Philosophers\" involves a qualitative analysis based on interviews conducted with professional philosophers. Here is an overview of the proposed method or model, including key components and innovations:\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **Participant Selection**:\n    - Interviews were conducted with 21 professional philosophers from 14 philosophy departments at doctoral universities in the United States.\n    - Philosophers were chosen to ensure high diversity in their areas of interest, such as ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of science.\n\n2. **Interview Process**:\n    - The interviews took place online, lasting between 30 to 60 minutes, contingent on the interviewee's availability.\n    - Interviewees were questioned on their methods of philosophizing, including where their ideas originate, how they develop their ideas, and what resources they require.\n    - Additionally, participants were asked about their views on Language Models (LMs), such as whether LMs can \"do\" philosophy and how they might be useful in philosophizing.\n\n3. **Script and Flexibility**:\n    - The questions followed a loose script (referenced in \u00a7A.1), with flexibility to ask novel follow-up questions based on the interviewees' responses to delve deeper into interesting areas.\n\n4. **Interaction with LMs**:\n    - For those philosophers with little or no prior exposure to LMs, they interacted live with the GPT-4 model on a philosophical topic of their choosing during the interview.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**:\n    - The study received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the university. \n    - All interviewees provided consent to participate and for their responses to be used in the development of the article.\n\n### Innovations in Method:\n\n- **Inductive and Open Coding Analysis**:\n    - Interviews were analyzed both via recordings and transcripts using an inductive approach as per Thomas (2006) and open coding as described by Charmaz (2006). \n    - This method helped identify common themes and positions, which structured sections (\u00a74 and \u00a75) of the analysis.\n\n- **Unique Identifiers for Reliability**:\n    - Interviewees are referred to with unique identifiers (e.g., P1, P2, P3) to cite their responses accurately and maintain confidentiality.\n\nThis methodological approach allowed the researchers to gather a broad spectrum of perspectives on the role and potential of LMs in philosophical practice, providing a nuanced understanding of how these tools can intersect with traditional and contemporary philosophical methods.\n",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup and Results:**\n\n**Experiment Setup:**\n- **Participants:** The experiment involved interviewing multiple philosophers (referred to with IDs such as P1, P2, P13, etc.) to gather their perspectives on the utility of Language Models (LMs) as tools for critical thinking.\n- **Purpose:** The aim was to assess to what extent current LMs can assist philosophers in their intellectual processes, both in routine tasks and in contexts requiring deep critical thinking.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics and Methodology:**\n- *Qualitative Interviews:* Philosophers were asked about their experiences and perspectives regarding the use of LMs.\n- *Relevance and Utility:* Philosophers\u2019 responses were categorized based on their views on the relevance and potential uses of LMs.\n- *Critical Thinking Evaluation:* Specific attention was given to whether philosophers found LMs capable of assisting in complex intellectual and critical thinking tasks.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\n1. **Findings on Relevance and Utility:**\n   - Many philosophers found LMs to be relevant and interesting.\n   - Some identified limited practical uses for LMs, particularly in contexts like undergraduate instruction (mentioned by P1, P13, P20) or for getting acquainted with new topics (noted by P5, P11, P12).\n\n2. **Critical Thinking Limitations:**\n   - None of the interviewed philosophers were convinced that current LMs can reliably and conveniently assist in intellectually substantive ways that require critical thinking.\n   - Descriptive terms used by philosophers to characterize LMs included \u201cboring\u201d (P2), \u201canodyne\u201d (P4), \u201cbland\u201d (P9), and \u201ccowardly\u201d (P13).\n\n3. **Reasons for Limitations:**\n   - **Neutrality and Detachment:** LMs were perceived as highly neutral, detached, and non-judgmental, making comments in abstract and decontextualized ways.\n   - **Passive and Incurious Behavior:** LMs were seen as servile and passive, which restricted their usefulness, particularly when the user did not have a clear vision of what they wanted to achieve.\n\nThis summary of the main experiment provides insight into the perceived capabilities and shortcomings of current LMs from the perspective of professional philosophers, emphasizing a significant gap in the ability of these models to support tasks demanding deep intellectual engagement and critical thinking."
