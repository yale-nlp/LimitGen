(2006  ###reference_b6###); Colley and Comber (2003  ###reference_b5###), an LLM that embodies the values of a tech-savvy individual may lead to less empathetic interactions.\nMinimizing the value disparities between LLMs and the older population has the potential to lead to better communication between these demographics and the digital products they engage with.\n###figure_1### In this paper, we investigate whether and which values in LLMs are more aligned with specific age groups. Specifically, by using the World Value Survey Haerpfer et al. (2020  ###reference_b10###), we prompt various LLMs to elicit their values on thirteen categories, employing eight format variations in prompts for robust testing. We observe a general inclination of LLM values towards younger demographics, as shown in Fig 1  ###reference_###. We also demonstrate the specific categories of value and example inquiries where LLMs exhibit such age preferences (See Sec 4  ###reference_###).\nFurthermore, we study the effect of adding age identity information when prompting LLMs. Specifically, we instruct LLMs to use an age and country identity before requesting their responses. Surprisingly, we find that adding age identity fails to eliminate the value discrepancies with targeted age groups on eight out of thirteen categories (see Fig 4  ###reference_###), despite occasional success in specific instances (See Sec 5  ###reference_###).\nWe advocate for increased awareness within the research community regarding the potential age bias inherent in LLMs, particularly concerning their predisposition towards certain values. We also emphasize the complexities involved in calibrating prompts to effectively address this bias."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe motivation behind this paper stems from the necessity for widely-used Large Language Models (LLMs) to represent and be reflective of diverse age groups. Given the growing demographic of older adults, both in the U.S. and worldwide, it becomes crucial to examine how LLMs' value inclinations align\u2014or fail to align\u2014with the values held by different age demographics. Misalignment may result in less empathetic and effective interactions, thereby potentially alienating segments of the population from digital interactions that are increasingly central to everyday life.\n\n### Research Problem\nThis paper addresses the research problem of whether LLMs' value inclinations align with specific age groups and seeks to identify which values are more closely associated with younger or older demographics. Moreover, it investigates the efficacy of using age identity information in prompts to mitigate any detected discrepancies.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Demographic Representation in LLMs**: Previous research has underscored the importance of demographic inclusivity in LLMs to ensure that diverse user groups have positive interactions with these models (Dwivedi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019; Hong et al., 2023).\n2. **Demographic Trends**: Vespa et al. (2018) and the World Health Organization (2022) have highlighted the increasing proportion of older adults, making it pertinent to consider how this demographic interacts with technology.\n3. **Technology Adoption by Older Adults**: Studies by Czaja et al. (2006) and Colley and Comber (2003) indicate that older adults generally show less inclination towards new technologies, suggesting that an LLM biased towards younger, tech-savvy values may not meet the needs of this group.\n4. **World Value Survey Utilization**: The World Value Survey (Haerpfer et al., 2020) serves as a foundational tool to elicit and analyze the values represented in LLMs across age demographics, providing a structured approach to compare these values systematically.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the paper aims to contribute to the understanding and mitigation of age biases in LLMs, enhancing their usability for a broader spectrum of age groups.\n\n",
        "methodology": "### Investigating LLM\u2019s Value Inclination on the Perspective of Age\n#### Methodology\n\n##### Overview\n\nThe methodology for exploring the value inclinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) against human values is based on data from the 7th wave of the World Values Survey (WVS) (Haerpfer et al., 2020). The WVS probes 94,000 individuals globally on 13 categories encompassing social, political, economic, religious, and cultural values, with each inquiry represented as single-choice questions quantified numerically.\n\n##### Data Preparation\n\n1. **Human Values Computation**:\n   - **Grouping by Age and Country**: Respondents are categorized into age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+ years) and by country.\n   - **Average Value Calculation**: The average values for each age and country cohort are calculated, ignoring invalid negative numbers.\n\n2. **LLM Analysis**:\n   - **Six LLMs**: Analysis is conducted on six distinct LLMs.\n   - **Survey Inquiry Components**: For each survey inquiry, three key components are identified: context, question ID & content, and options.\n\n##### Prompt Design\n\n- **Format Variations**: To ensure robustness, eight distinct prompts per inquiry are created by making format variations (e.g., alternating wordings and order of components). This approach addresses inconsistencies in LLM performance noted in previous studies (Shu et al., 2023; R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024; Beck et al., 2023).\n\n##### Response Analysis\n\n1. **Response Stability**:\n   - **Multiple Trials**: Multiple prompt trials identify a convergence point for LLM responses. On 95.5% of questions, the majority of the eight prompts led to responses centered on the same choice or adjacent options.\n   - **Unexpected Replies**: Seven types of unexpected replies were encountered, and coping methods for each are summarized.\n\n2. **Averaging Responses**:\n   - Similar to human values, invalid negative numbers are ignored during the averaging process of LLM responses.\n\n##### Reproducing Work\n\n- For the replication of the study, detailed parameter settings and prompting details are reported in Appendix D.\n\n---\n\nThis methodology leverages systematic data categorization and robust prompts to measure the convergence of responses amongst LLMs, ensuring the relevance and consistency of results against human value benchmarks.",

The models analyzed include popular LLMs, with ChatGPT being one highlighted example.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics**:\n- **Trend Coefficient**: Measures the inclination of the models towards values of younger demographics.\n- **Alignment Rank**: Assesses the degree of value alignment between the model responses and the values of specific age groups.\n\n#### Main Experimental Results:\n\n- **US and China**: The models demonstrate a higher alignment rank with younger age groups across most value categories. Exceptions include categories like happiness and well-being, where the trend may differ.\n- **Ethiopia and Nigeria**: The models show a less evident inclination toward younger age groups, with no significant trend observed.\n\nSignificant testing outcomes and additional details on other models and countries are referenced in the appendices."
