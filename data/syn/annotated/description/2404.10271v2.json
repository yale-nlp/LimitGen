    "title": "Social Choice Should Guide AI Alignment in Dealing with Diverse Human Feedback",
    "abstract": "Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, such as helping to commit crimes or producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans\u2019 expressed preferences over multiple outputs. Another approach is constitutional AI, in which the input from humans is a list of high-level principles. But\nhow do we deal with potentially diverging input from humans? How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about \u201ccollective\u201d preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior?\nIn this paper, we argue that the field of social choice is well positioned to address these questions, and we discuss ways forward for this agenda, drawing on discussions in a recent workshop on\nSocial Choice for AI Ethics and Safety held in Berkeley, CA, USA in December 2023.",

            "text": "Recently, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the primary strategy that leading AI companies such as OpenAI (OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b80###), Anthropic (Anthropic, 2023  ###reference_b1###), Meta (Meta, 2023  ###reference_b73###), and Google (Google, 2023  ###reference_b47###) use to make pretrained large language models (LLMs) more capable and controllable (Christiano et al., 2017  ###reference_b19###; Ziegler et al., 2019  ###reference_b110###) and to align them with human values. However, RLHF faces many limitations and challenges (Casper et al., 2023  ###reference_b15###; Lambert & Calandra, 2023  ###reference_b61###), including unrepresentative data (Prabhakaran et al., 2021  ###reference_b88###; Feffer et al., 2023  ###reference_b36###), unrealistic models of human decision-making (Hong et al., 2022  ###reference_b53###; Freedman et al., 2021  ###reference_b41###; Siththaranjan et al., 2023  ###reference_b99###; Lambert et al., 2023  ###reference_b62###), and insufficient modeling of human diversity (Kirk et al., 2023  ###reference_b57###; Freedman et al., 2023  ###reference_b42###) which may lead to political bias (Motoki et al., 2023  ###reference_b75###; Rozado, 2024  ###reference_b90###).\nWe propose that ideas from social choice theory (Arrow, 2012  ###reference_b3###; Fishburn, 1973  ###reference_b38###; Kelly, 1988  ###reference_b56###; Brandt et al., 2015  ###reference_b13###)\u2014e.g., concerning whose preferences should be integrated into decisions and how this should be done\u2014are needed to solve many of these open problems.\nWhile models that are solely pretrained on internet data may produce repetitive or harmful text, RLHF trains models to follow instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022  ###reference_b82###) and produce helpful and \u201charmless\u201d outputs (Bai et al., 2022a  ###reference_b7###) based on human judgments.\nRLHF gathers example outputs from a pretrained LLM or examples written by humans.\nNext, humans are asked to select the outputs that best meet specified criteria (such as being \u201chelpful\u201d or \u201cunbiased\u201d).\nThese judgments, often called preferences, are then used to fine-tune the LLM.\nFrom a social choice perspective, this method raises several critical questions: Which humans are asked to judge outputs? What criteria do they use? How are their judgments combined? And how do their expressed judgments relate to their actual preferences?\nConstitutional AI (CAI), which involves reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), is an alternative addressing some of these questions (Bai et al., 2022b  ###reference_b8###).\nHumans produce a \u201cconstitution\u201d that specifies principles that the LLM is trained to align with.\nHowever, one must still decide who has input on the constitution and how it is constructed.\nBai et al. (2022b  ###reference_b8###) construct it \u201cin a fairly ad-hoc way [\u2026] for research purposes\u201d, but developing safe and ethical AI requires a more principled approach as in Ganguli et al. (2023  ###reference_b44###) or OpenAI (2024  ###reference_b81###). How then should one aggregate diverse preferences into a representative constitution?\nSocial choice theory has long studied similar questions.\nThis position paper argues that methods from social choice should be applied to address questions such as which humans should provide input, what type of feedback should be collected, and how it should be aggregated and used.\nBy taking into account the lessons from social choice theory, one can avoid na\u00efve mistakes and reinventing the wheel, while leveraging feedback to address challenging design problems (Dobbe et al., 2021  ###reference_b29###).\nWe also highlight areas in which new work is required to extend social choice to new problems unique to training safe and ethical AI.\nThere are several advantages to addressing the above problems in a principled way. First, it will likely result in a fairer system, taking into account the input of a broader group of people. Second, it promises to give generally more accurate feedback about questions of truthfulness, as suggested by a significant body of literature on \u201cepistemic democracy\u201d\u2014voting to settle questions about facts (Pivato, 2017  ###reference_b87###). Intuitively, having input from diverse people makes it less likely that something important is missed. Third, it will likely result in broader buy-in into the system.\nOne may have concerns about this approach; for example, will feedback from diverse people be inconsistent and result in inconsistent system behavior? Social choice theory provides examples where na\u00efve aggregation of preferences or judgments leads to seemingly irrational collective choices, such as cyclical preferences (Schwartz, 2018  ###reference_b95###) or logically inconsistent conclusions (List & Pettit, 2002  ###reference_b69###). Then again, social choice theory also provides the tools for thinking about such issues and preventing them.\nSocial choice is not new to computer scientists; computational social choice (Brandt et al., 2015  ###reference_b13###) is a well-studied topic, with a biennial workshop since 2006. However, while many of those researchers affiliate with the AI community, there has not yet been much work connecting computational social choice to the alignment of modern AI systems.\nIn the following, we first give background on value alignment, RLHF, and social choice. Then we discuss several questions at their intersection. We think that significant further research is needed to answer these questions well and that good answers are needed in order to build AI systems in a responsible way based on potentially diverging feedback from multiple stakeholders. In contrast, ad-hoc approaches may result in systems that fail to represent their stakeholders well, that marginalize significant groups of stakeholders, and that create a basis for conflict between groups of people or the multiple AI systems that represent them."

            "text": "Modern social choice theory began in the 1960s with Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem (Arrow, 1951  ###reference_b2###; McLean & Urken, 1995  ###reference_b71###). Arrow considered the problem of aggregating multiple individuals\u2019 preferences\u2014in his case rankings\u2014into a social preference, subject to some desiderata. In particular, he required the aggregation function to be defined for any family of individual preferences; that the social preference relation be complete and transitive (it is then called a social welfare function); that the social preference between alternatives  and  should depend only on individual preferences between  and  (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, IIA); and that unanimous individual preference for  over  should imply social preference for  over . Arrow proved that the only aggregation functions satisfying these desiderata are dictatorships: there is one individual  such that no matter what others prefer, if  prefers  to , then the social preference ranks  above  as well.111Mishra (2023  ###reference_b74###) applies Arrow\u2019s Theorem to RLHF. A similar theorem (see Taylor 2005  ###reference_b103###, \u00a7 1.3) holds for social choice functions where, instead of asking for a social ranking, we ask for just a single winner, or even just a set of choice-worthy alternatives. Arrow\u2019s Theorem stimulated a huge literature exploring the consequences of weakening his desiderata (see, e.g., Campbell & Kelly 2002  ###reference_b14###, Holliday & Pacuit 2020  ###reference_b52###). The general takeaway is that for ordinal preference aggregation, in order to avoid dictatorships, oligarchies and vetoers, one must weaken IIA and allow the social preference between  and  to depend in part on preferences involving other alternatives. This allows for many alternative methods of aggregating individual preferences (see, e.g., Brams & Fishburn 2002  ###reference_b11###; Zwicker 2016  ###reference_b112###; Pacuit 2019  ###reference_b83### and the voting methods in the Preferential Voting Tools  ###reference_st/### library). Figure 1  ###reference_### gives an example in which three well-known methods disagree. The costs and benefits of these and other methods are systematically studied from various angles (axiomatic, computational, empirical, etc.) in social choice theory. Since Arrow, social choice theory has grown to study aggregation not only of individuals\u2019 preferences, both ordinal and cardinal (d\u2019Aspremont & Gevers, 2002  ###reference_b27###), but also of their approvals of alternatives (Laslier & Sanver, 2010  ###reference_b65###), grades given to alternatives (Balinski & Laraki, 2010  ###reference_b10###), judgments about propositions (Grossi & Pigozzi, 2022  ###reference_b49###), subjective probabilities for propositions (Dietrich & List, 2016  ###reference_b28###), and other types of objects (Rubinstein & Fishburn, 1986  ###reference_b91###). Recent work has also started to explore social choice methods for RLHF (Song et al., 2024  ###reference_b100###; Swamy et al., 2024  ###reference_b102###; Dai & Fleisig, 2024  ###reference_b26###; Ge et al., 2024  ###reference_b45###). In the following, we discuss some of the aggregation problems that might arise in the context of AI alignment."

            "text": "If we want to use social choice methods for aligning AI systems, we first need to specify what the concrete options/objects are, then collect preferences over them, and finally make actual or simulated collective choices between them. These options are called alternatives.\nIn some contexts, the set of alternatives is easy to comprehend and enumerate, e.g. candidates for a position. In other settings, there are exponentially many alternatives, but the set is still easy to comprehend, e.g., if each of  propositions must be either accepted or rejected (Lang, 2007  ###reference_b64###).\nFor AI alignment, it is harder to see how best to determine the set of alternatives for evaluation. It could be the set of all possible parameterizations of a given network architecture, but this would surely be conceptually intractable.\nFor an LLM, most RLHF approaches ask the evaluator to choose between a small, explicit set of alternative responses to some prompt, handwritten or sampled from the pretrained LLM. Alternately, we could consider all possible responses as alternatives. Evaluators could then indicate their preference by providing the preferred response themselves. Such exemplars are often used for fine-tuning and can be used to learn evaluators\u2019 preferences and generate responses that well-represent them (Fish et al., 2023  ###reference_b37###).\nWhile this does not address questions about how to generalize beyond a single prompt, it is a useful way of conceptualizing the alternatives.\nOne might conceive of the alternatives as probability distributions over responses; LLMs are anyway configured to respond stochastically. This might be desirable not only for creativity but also to promote fairness and representativeness of responses. In response to a controversial question, fairness might militate against always giving the same answer, as any one answer will inevitably omit some relevant considerations on one side of a debate. There is a large literature on social choice rules that output probability distributions. Their input could be the evaluators\u2019 stated preferences between distributions (Fishburn 1973  ###reference_b38###, Ch. 18), or stated preferences between plain alternatives (Brandt, 2017  ###reference_b12###), since evaluators might have difficulties comparing probability distributions. Indeed, the type of objects chosen by a social choice rule (e.g., distributions over responses) need not match the type of objects about which individuals state preferences (e.g., responses).\nMulti-winner rules (Faliszewski et al., 2017  ###reference_b35###; Elkind et al., 2017  ###reference_b32###) form a middle ground between deterministic single-winner rules and probabilistic rules. They pick a small, predetermined number of answers that best reflect what the voters want, which could be combined into a single response that lists these answers as bullet points to provide the user with a representative overview of possible answers."

When it is infeasible to elicit feedback from all stakeholders, we must select a smaller group to query. One can try to select a suitably representative subset such that the alignment obtained using their feedback sufficiently approximates the alignment that would be obtained from all stakeholders\u2019 feedback.\nHere one could draw on ongoing work in social choice theory on how to select citizens\u2019 assemblies that are representative of a full population (e.g., Flanigan et al. 2021  ###reference_b39###; Landemore & Fourniau 2022  ###reference_b63###), as well as work in statistics on efficient stratified sampling (e.g., Meng 2013  ###reference_b72###).\nAlternatively, one could let stakeholders vote on their representatives, e.g., with a voting procedure designed to elect proportionally representative assemblies (see, e.g., Ch. 4 of Lackner & Skowron 2023  ###reference_b59###). Stakeholders might also delegate their feedback rights to others (who may in turn delegate, etc.), as in liquid democracy (see Paulin 2020  ###reference_b85###).\nWork up to now has used evaluator recruitment methods such as Mechanical Turk (Freedman et al., 2020  ###reference_b40###; Bai et al., 2022a  ###reference_b7###); Upwork, Scale AI, or Lionbridge (Stiennon et al., 2020  ###reference_b101###; Ziegler et al., 2019  ###reference_b110###); and purpose-built platforms (Noothigattu et al., 2018  ###reference_b78###).

Having them sort responses alphabetically may satisfy 1 and 3, but not 2. Having them directly rank neural networks based on inspecting their weights may satisfy 3 but not 1 or 2.\nNeedless to say, different choices for the type of input may lead to differently aligned systems and have different behavioral effects on humans (cf. Section 8  ###reference_###).\nPerhaps one should let individuals choose the format in which they give input or feedback. In traditional social choice this is uncommon\u2014though there may be some flexibility in how preferences are expressed (e.g., allowing voters to only rank a few alternatives rather than all (Halpern et al., 2023  ###reference_b50###), or to give numerical ratings instead of rankings) and some variety in the interaction mechanism (e.g., one can vote for candidates individually, or pull a lever to vote for all candidates of a single party at once). Going forward, however, it is easy to imagine giving evaluators choices from a range of different ways to give their input. For example, the input could be individual responses, whole dialogue sessions, longterm interactions with the same user, or published guiding principles. The feedback could be expressed as approval/disapproval votes, pairwise comparisons of alternatives, full or partial rankings of the alternatives, giving precise or imprecise ratings of the form \u201cI rate A between 7 and 9\u201d, or even in free-form verbal feedback that an LLM can interpret as some formal preference data such as a partial ordering. Moreover, the evaluation could be on various aspects of the system\u2019s behavioral patterns, as done in fine-grained RLHF (Wu et al., 2023  ###reference_b106###), or in RLHF that optimizes for multiple attributes (Dong et al., 2023  ###reference_b30###) such as helpfulness, humor, toxicity, etc.\nSection 5.2  ###reference_### discusses how we may process all this heterogeneous data."

Instead of a single evaluator, we may ask the members of a jury  to provide individual rankings . Using some ordinal social welfare function , those rankings can then be aggregated into a collective ranking  to be used in step (3). We call this \u201cRLCHF using aggregated rankings\u201d (Fig. 2  ###reference_###).\n###figure_2### Alternatively, one could use cardinal preference aggregation between steps (3) and (4). For this, change step (3) so that a model of individual preferences is trained, mapping pair  and evaluator  with features  to predicted ratings . Also, generate a large sample of feature vectors  that is representative of the stakeholder population. Then a cardinal social welfare function  can be used to aggregate simulated individual ratings into a social rating  which can be used in step (4).

A different approach would replace reinforcement learning by something else and introduce social choice methods in the form of simulated collective decisions rather than preference aggregation.\nFor one thing, one could modify \u201cRLCHF using evaluator features and aggregated ratings\u201d into \u201cSupervised Learning from Simulated Collective Decisions\u201d, as shown in Fig. 4  ###reference_###.

Then in step (4), use data point  to train the actual AI system via supervised (rather than reinforcement) learning.\nInstead of picking a single winner , we could also use a multi-winner social choice function  that outputs, say, a set of three responses . These can then be (creatively) combined into a single response, e.g.,\nby merging them into a bullet-point list and adding \u201cThe following are (three) typical answers to your question: \u2026\u201d at the beginning.\nA more radical modification would drop the fine-tuning-via-learning step altogether (leaving the LLM only pretrained) and instead simulate the collective choice at inference time.

Here, too,  could be a multi-winner or probabilistic social choice rule."

This is relevant when voting over the internet, but irrelevant for in-person faculty meetings where faculty vote publicly by raising their hands.\nSo, rather than studying every single social-choice-theoretic concept in the context of aligning AI systems,\nwe should be careful to evaluate which traditional concepts are most relevant. In the following, we give just a few examples."

Such alternatives are referred to as clones, a notion that can be formalized in several ways. According to a strict notion of clones (Tideman, 1987  ###reference_b104###),  and  are clones if, for every individual, if that individual prefers  to some other alternative , then they also prefer  to , and if they instead prefer  to , then they also prefer  to . According to a more liberal notion (Laffond et al., 1996  ###reference_b60###),  and  are clones if, whenever a majority of individuals prefer  to some other alternative , then a majority prefers  to  as well, and whenever a majority prefers some  to , then a majority prefers  to  as well.\nSometimes the introduction of a clone can affect the outcome of an election. Suppose a group of people are voting over where to go for dinner, and the only two alternatives are a Chinese restaurant and an Indian restaurant. 52% of the voters prefer the Chinese restaurant. But then, someone points out that the Chinese restaurant has two floors and argues that the two floors should be considered separate options.\nSo now the alternatives are , , and . Nobody really cares all that much about the floor, but suppose that 26% of the voters prefer , and 26% of the voters prefer  (adding up to the original 52%). Further suppose that the voting rule used is Plurality, in which the alternative that appears at the very top of voters\u2019 rankings the most often wins. Then the Indian restaurant ends up winning now with 48% of the vote. This seems like an undesirable property for a voting rule to have; it would be better for the introduction of a clone never to make a difference.444More precisely, introducing a clone should not affect whether a non-clone (e.g., the Indian restaurant in our example) is selected or which non-clone is selected. But it may affect which clone, if any, is selected. For instance, a clone-independent rule could select  over  in our example, if among the 48% of people who prefer , a strict majority of them prefer  to . This latter desirable property is called independence of clones. Perhaps when choosing restaurants, this is not that relevant, as restaurants will rarely be clones (unless the floors of restaurants are treated separately). On the other hand, when choosing responses for a chatbot, it may be quite common for two responses to be very close to each other, indicating its importance to this context. We note that Borda Count (see Figure 1  ###reference_###), which is implicitly used in some standard approaches to RLHF (Siththaranjan et al. 2023  ###reference_b99###), badly violates independence of clones."

            "text": "Another concern is strategic voting (or strategic feedback).\nStrategic voting consists of casting a vote that does not reflect one\u2019s true preferences, in order to obtain a better result for oneself. For example, consider an election with plurality voting, as described above. A voter might perceive that her top-ranked alternative has no chance of winning and therefore strategically vote for another alternative.\nStrategic voting poses a problem because we can no longer take votes (or feedback) at face value. Unfortunately, in general, every reasonable voting rule will sometimes introduce incentives to manipulate (Gibbard, 1973  ###reference_b46###; Satterthwaite, 1975  ###reference_b93###). These incentives to manipulate might be reduced if voters lack full information about the preferences of other voters (Conitzer et al., 2011  ###reference_b24###) or about the voting rule that will be used (Holliday & Pacuit, 2019  ###reference_b51###). But we often cannot guarantee such ignorance, just as we often cannot guarantee computer security through obscurity.\nWhat form might strategic voting in a context such as RLHF take? If rating responses range on a scale from (say) 0 to 10, a natural strategy is to overreport. E.g., if one evaluator does not really like a response (at the level of a 3), but suspects that others would like it (say, two other evaluators give it a 6), then this evaluator may strategically give a rating of 0 to \u201ccompensate\u201d for the other reviewers. This manipulation would be successful if we eventually aggregate ratings by taking their average: the average will be pulled down to 4, instead of the 5 that would result from reporting truthfully, so that the average is closer to the 3 that the evaluator believes is ideal. If instead we use the median as the aggregate, then this manipulation is ineffective\u2014the median would remain 6. Indeed, the median is strategy-proof in this context: misreporting one\u2019s preferences never helps, as long as one\u2019s only goal is to move the median rating closer to one\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d rating (cf.

Anonymity prohibits not only the extremes of dictatorship (recall Section 2.5  ###reference_###) but even any kind of weighted voting wherein some voters\u2019 votes count for more than others. However, in the context of AI development, one might consider aggregating human feedback in a way that violates anonymity (cf. the weighted majority rule discussed in Nitzan & Paroush 1982  ###reference_b77###). Perhaps some evaluators are more experienced or more highly rated than others; perhaps some are influenced by others, so their input should not be considered completely independent inputs for aggregation; and so on.

In some applications of social choice to AI ethics and safety, possibly including Constitutional AI (recall Section 2.4  ###reference_###), we might regard different ethical principles as the \u201cvoters\u201d who can rank or otherwise evaluate the outputs of an AI system (cf. Greene et al. 2016  ###reference_b48###). This is analogous to applications of social choice theory in the philosophy of science, where the \u201cvoters\u201d are theoretical virtues that may rank scientific theories differently (Okasha, 2011  ###reference_b79###), or to multi-criteria decision-making, where the \u201cvoters\u201d are relevant factors that may rank the options differently (Arrow & Raynaud, 1986  ###reference_b4###). Of course, such ethical principles could themselves be outputs of some prior social choice procedure in which the voters are humans (cf. Collective Constitutional AI in Ganguli et al. 2023  ###reference_b44###).\nThis suggests a possible alternative architecture for applying social choice to AI\u2014one sitting somewhere between the extremes of a spectrum that ranges from Constitutional AI at one end (in which principles are the whole show, while social choice does not appear) to the RLHF version of reinforcement learning as described in previous sections (where principles play no role at all). In this alternative model, each respondent would be required to justify her rankings of alternative AI responses in terms of their level of satisfaction of each of a number of principles taken from a fixed menu. The AI system would use the results to train for several independent tasks: for each principle, separately learn how to rate responses to queries based on that principle alone; and learn how to aggregate those separate ratings into an overall rating of the responses. These would be composed to form the final stage of a simulated collective decision\u2014the stage in which the voters are the principles."

If there is a significant disagreement, then rather than forcing a minority to go someplace they really do not like, it can make sense to split into multiple groups, each going to their favorite restaurant. Similarly, perhaps it makes sense to create multiple AI systems\u2014for example, to recognize strong inter- and intra-cultural variations that have been identified in some non-homogenous populations (Awad et al., 2018  ###reference_b5###; Peters & Carman, 2024  ###reference_b86###).\nDepending on the situation, the people providing feedback might be split into groups ex ante (e.g., each country makes a system based on their own citizens\u2019 feedback), but also ex post, where we first collect feedback and then form groups of people. The latter approach is closely related to the topic of representation in voting theory (Faliszewski et al., 2017  ###reference_b35###).\nThere is also the slightly different scenario where one AI system is in place, and some group of people believe that it is not serving them well. Hence, they might decide to pool their resources and create their own system. The literature on cooperative game theory\n(cf. Chalkiadakis et al. 2011  ###reference_b18###), sometimes referred to as coalitional game theory, touches on these considerations (and indeed also plays a role in questions of representation, as in Aziz et al. 2017  ###reference_b6###).\nFinally, let us highlight possible shortcomings to creating multiple AI systems.\nAs in the restaurant example, it may have the result of unnecessarily dividing people into separate groups. Moreover, splitting into groups may not be feasible if it does not dovetail with existing social structures. For example, the US Federal Government may want to adopt a single system that will impact all its citizens, and adopting two systems would be tantamount to splitting the country in two.\nFinally, unlike in the case of the restaurants, the multiple AI systems may have to interact with each other, creating the risk of conflict between AIs with different goals. The nascent literature on cooperative AI (Dafoe et al., 2021  ###reference_b25###; Conitzer & Oesterheld, 2023  ###reference_b20###) may help ensure these interactions do not result in adverse outcomes. Nonetheless, it might be best to see if we can completely avoid having multiple AIs with competing goals, or at least design them in a way that makes conflict between them less likely."

        "research_background": "### Motivation:\nThe primary motivation for this paper stems from the increasing reliance on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align large language models (LLMs) with human values. Major AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google use RLHF to make LLMs more capable and controllable. Despite its prominence, RLHF faces several challenges and limitations, such as unrepresentative data, unrealistic models of human decision-making, and inadequate consideration of human diversity. The authors propose that concepts from social choice theory, which deal with integrating diverse human preferences into decision-making processes, could address these challenges and improve the alignment of AI with human values.\n\n### Research Problem:\nThe central research problem the paper aims to tackle is how to effectively aggregate and integrate diverse human feedback into the training of AI systems, in order to ensure these systems are safe, ethical, and representative of the broader population. Specifically, the paper seeks to address:\n1. Which humans should provide input for training AI systems?\n2. What types of feedback should be collected?\n3. How should this feedback be aggregated and used in the AI development process?\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**:\n   - RLHF is utilized by leading AI companies to make pretrained LLMs follow instructions and produce helpful outputs based on human judgments. However, it faces limitations such as unrepresentative data and insufficient modeling of human diversity.\n   - Prior works in RLHF include those by Christiano et al. (2017) and Ziegler et al. (2019) laying foundational methods, as well as critiques and analyses by Casper et al. (2023) and Lambert & Calandra (2023).\n\n2. **Limitations and Challenges in Current Models**:\n   - Issues like unrepresentative data (Prabhakaran et al., 2021; Feffer et al., 2023), unrealistic models of human decision-making (Hong et al., 2022; Freedman et al., 2021; Siththaranjan et al., 2023), and insufficient modeling of human diversity (Kirk et al., 2023; Freedman et al., 2023) have been highlighted in recent works, raising concerns about political bias (Motoki et al., 2023; Rozado, 2024).\n\n3. **Alternative Approaches**:\n   - Constitutional AI (CAI), another method involving reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), has been explored by Bai et al. (2022b), but it also requires principled approaches for developing a representative constitution for AI systems.\n\n4. **Social Choice Theory**:\n   - Concepts from social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Fishburn, 1973; Kelly, 1988; Brandt et al., 2015) offer a framework to address the integration of diverse human preferences into AI training. These principles have yet to be extensively applied to the alignment of modern AI systems despite significant applications in computational social choice.\n\n5. **Epistemic Democracy**:\n   - Literature on \"epistemic democracy,\" which involves using collective voting to settle questions about facts, suggests that diverse input can lead to more accurate outcomes (Pivato, 2017).\n\nBy leveraging these prior works, the paper aims to introduce a principled method inspired by social choice theory to improve how AI systems are trained and aligned, addressing critical issues of fairness, inclusivity, and consistency in decision-making.",
        "methodology": "Certainly! Here is a description of the proposed method or model from the methodology section:\n\n---\n\nThe paper introduces two primary approaches to incorporate diverse human feedback into AI systems, leveraging principles from social choice theory. The goal is to ensure the AI aligns more closely with collective human preferences.\n\n### Approach 1: Reinforcement Learning from Collective Human Feedback (RLCHF)\n1. **Preference Aggregation Step**: This approach suggests integrating an additional step during the AI training process that aggregates diverse human preferences. \n2. **Transformation of RLHF to RLCHF**: Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is enhanced to consider collective input, evolving into Reinforcement Learning from Collective Human Feedback (RLCHF). \n3. **Key Component**: The critical innovation here is the aggregation step that systematically combines multiple individual preferences into a collective feedback input, influencing the reinforcement learning process.\n\n### Approach 2: Simulated Collective Decision Procedure\n1. **Collective Decision Integration**: This approach advocates for incorporating a simulated collective decision-making step either during training or within the AI system's real-time decision-making process.\n2. **Inspiration from Existing Works**: The methodology draws on established ideas from Bakker et al. (2022) and Jarrett et al. (2023).\n3. **Key Component**: The main innovation is the simulation of collective decisions, which introduces a layer where the system considers combined feedback before making final decisions or adjustments in real-time.\n\nBoth approaches aim to enhance AI alignment by ensuring that the system not only receives and processes individual human feedback but also respects and integrates collective preferences in a consistent manner. \n\n--- \n\nThese methodologies are geared toward developing AI systems that better reflect the collective values and preferences of diverse human populations.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "The main experiment setup involves creating a hypothetical stakeholder population of individuals who will be affected by an AI system and whose preferences should ideally guide the alignment of that system. This setup assumes that it is not feasible to gather feedback from all potential stakeholders due to practical constraints. Therefore, the challenge is to select a representative subset from which feedback can be effectively elicited to approximate what would be obtained if feedback from all stakeholders were possible.\n\n### Datasets:\n1. **Stakeholder population**: This hypothetical group includes all individuals who will be affected by the AI system. It mentions that certain groups (such as small children and non-human animals) may require proxy representation.\n2. **Evaluator recruitment methods**: Methods previously used include Amazon Mechanical Turk, Upwork, Scale AI, Lionbridge, and purpose-built platforms.\n\n### Selection Methods:\n1. **Social Choice Theory**: Techniques would be drawn from social choice theory to select a representative subset of stakeholders. Methods include using citizens' assemblies' representativeness (citing Flanigan et al., 2021, and Landemore & Fourniau, 2022) and efficient stratified sampling approaches (citing Meng, 2013).\n2. **Voting Procedures**: Stakeholders could vote on their representatives using procedures designed to elect proportionally representative assemblies (referenced in Lackner & Skowron, 2023).\n3. **Liquid Democracy**: Delegation of feedback rights could also follow liquid democracy principles, where stakeholders may delegate their feedback rights to others, who could further delegate these rights (citing Paulin, 2020).\n\n### Baselines:\n1. **Mechanical Turk**: includes researchers like Freedman et al. (2020) and Bai et al. (2022a).\n2. **Freelance platforms**: includes works sourced from Upwork, Scale AI, and Lionbridge (referenced in studies by Stiennon et al. 2020, and Ziegler et al. 2019).\n3. **Purpose-built platforms**: such as those referenced by Noothigattu et al., 2018.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics:\nThe paper suggests the need for new metrics informed by social choice theory to evaluate the representativeness and effectiveness of the selected stakeholder subsets. Existing methods lack in-depth discussions informed by these theoretical frameworks, thus urging a detailed evaluation method drawn from social choice theory principles.\n\n### Main Experimental Results:\nThe text does not specify concrete results as it is primarily focused on outlining the experimental setup and suggesting future directions rather than reporting outcomes of empirical testing. The main findings emphasize the importance of incorporating insights from social choice theory into the selection procedures for evaluators to ensure that the resulting AI alignment reflects the diverse and representative preferences of the stakeholder population.\n\n### Summary:\nThe main experiment setup and proposed methods highlight the necessity of selecting a representative subset of stakeholders using theories and methods from social choice, voting procedures, and liquid democracy principles. Although specific empirical results are not provided, the emphasis is placed on the theoretical justification and the need for aligned stakeholder feedback to guide AI alignment processes effectively."
