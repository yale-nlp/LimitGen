            "text": "Hypothesis generation drives scientific progress.\nMendel\u2019s hypothesis on allele pairs lays the foundation for modern genetics;\nEinstein\u2019s hypothesis in general theory of relativity led to the prediction and subsequent confirmation of gravitational waves.\nIn the context of language modeling, the hypothesis on scaling law inspires recent progress in large language models (LLMs) (Chowdhery et al., 2022  ###reference_b6###).\nDespite the importance of hypothesis generation, as Ludwig & Mullainathan (2024  ###reference_b16###) points out, science has been curiously asymmetric.\nWhile many scientific publications present extensive formal and empirical evaluation of hypotheses, the generation of hypotheses happens off-stage by researchers.\nIn order to generate novel hypotheses, researchers may read literature, analyze data, pick the brain of each other, and even \u201challucinate\u201d (see Kekul\u00e9\u2019s discovery of the structure of the benzene molecule (Rothenberg, 1995  ###reference_b25###)).\nGiven the rise of large language models (Brown et al., 2020  ###reference_b5###; Anthropic, 2023  ###reference_b2###; OpenAI, 2023b  ###reference_b20###), we examine their potential of providing much needed assistance in hypothesis generation in this work.\nIn particular, we focus on hypothesis generation based on data, a common approach in empirical sciences.\nOur main question is how we can enable LLMs to generate hypotheses of high-quality.\nWhile one can easily prompt LLMs to generate hypotheses, LLMs may not be able to effectively leverage the input examples in a single long prompt.\nMoreover, it is important to have measures of quality in the generation process so that we can filter bad hypotheses and come up with better ones.\nThese two observations motivate us to start with a setup analogous to supervised learning.\nWe can iteratively prompt an LLM to generate hypotheses based on the training examples and use training accuracy as a measure of quality to guide the generation process.\nConveniently, we can also evaluate the quality of the final generated hypotheses with their performance on held-out examples, similar to supervised learning.\nTo generate high-quality hypotheses with LLMs, we propose an algorithm\ninspired by the upper confidence bound algorithm in multi-armed bandits (Auer, 2002  ###reference_b3###) (HypoGeniC, Hypothesis Generation in Context; see Figure 1  ###reference_###).\nGiven initial hypotheses generated from a small number of examples, we need to assess their quality and propose new hypotheses to address their deficiencies.\nTo navigate this exploration-exploitation tradeoff,\nwe introduce a\nreward function\nand evaluate the top  hypotheses for each\ntraining example.\nWe maintain a wrong example bank to capture the gap in knowledge of the current hypotheses pool, and\ngenerate new hypotheses based on the wrong example bank to close the gap.\n###figure_1### The generated hypotheses naturally enable an interpretable hypothesis-based classifier.\nWe propose a suite of inference strategies given a set of hypotheses.\nWe apply our method to one synthetic task where there is a single known valid hypothesis and three real-world tasks (Deceptive reviews,  and Tweet popularity).\nThe real-world tasks focus on deception detection and message popularity prediction, which are known to be challenging even for humans (Ott et al., 2011  ###reference_b21###; Salganik et al., 2006  ###reference_b27###).\nOur algorithm can recover the hypothesis in the synthetic task and also provide useful hypotheses for the real-world tasks.\nIn fact, our generated hypotheses\nconsistently outperform few-shot in-context learning baselines across all four tasks (31.7% in Shoe sales, 13.9% in Deceptive reviews, 3.3% in  and 24.9% in Tweet popularity).\nThe predictive performance matches and even outperforms oracle supervised learning with RoBERTa except in Deceptive reviews.\nIt is important to emphasize that although the utility of hypotheses in assisting downstream classification serves as an indicator for LLMs\u2019 ability to generate hypotheses,\nour primary interest lies in the quality of the hypotheses.\nThus, it is critical for the hypotheses to be interpretable beyond the LLM used to produce the hypotheses.\nWe show that hypotheses generated by one LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) can be used to make accurate inference by another LLM (e.g., Mixtral).\nOn an out-of-distribution dataset for Deceptive reviews, we can even outperform the oracle fine-tuned RoBERTa.\nSuch cross generalization provides strong evidence that we are able to generate hypotheses of high quality.\nFurthermore,\nthrough a qualitative analysis, our generated hypotheses\nnot only confirm theories from existing literature but also provide new insights about the task.\nFor instance, one novel hypothesis is that \u201creviews that mention personal experiences or special occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries, or weddings, are more likely to be truthful\u201d.\nWe encourage future research on deception detection to explore these novel hypotheses.\nOur work is connected to many recent studies on using LLMs to propose \u201chypotheses\u201d, notably, Qiu et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###) and Zhong et al. (2023  ###reference_b34###).\nQiu et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###) is motivated by testing the ability of LLMs to perform human-like induction reasoning,\nand Zhong et al. (2023  ###reference_b34###) aims to support open-ended exploration.\nWhile similar in spirit, we examine the case of generating theories between input and labels for challenging problems where even researchers may struggle with proposing new hypotheses.\nTo summarize, we highlight the following contributions:\nWe propose a novel computational framework for generating and evaluating hypotheses with large language models.\nOur generated hypotheses enable interpretable hypothesis-based classifiers that outperform in-context learning and even supervised learning for one synthetic and three real-world datasets. These hypotheses are also robust across different LLMs and out-of-distribution datasets.\nWe find our generated hypotheses to corroborate existing findings while also providing new insights for the tasks."

We note, however, that unlike the multi-arm bandit problem, multiple hypotheses are tested for a singular train example.\nMoreover,\nthere can be new arms after hypotheses are updated, altering the setting from the standard static arms scenario to a dynamic arms scenario.\nFormally, the reward is defined as\nwhere  is the set of examples that have been used to evaluate the hypothesis ,  is train time step, and  is a hyperparameter that controls the exploration term.\nThe first term in the reward function denotes the accuracy of the hypothesis for all .\nThe second term is the exploration term, which is computed based on the number of times the hypothesis has been selected and the number of training examples visited so far.\nThe accuracy term urges the algorithm to use well-performing hypotheses, whereas the exploration term encourages the algorithm to explore hypotheses that have not been selected many times.\nThus, the reward function strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation.\nFor more details on implementation of HypoGeniC, refer to \u00a7 B.1  ###reference_###."

The difference, however, is that it selects the most applicable hypothesis for each test example.\nSpecifically, for a given test example, the LLM is tasked with identifying the most applicable hypothesis from a set of options.\nFor each hypothesis, we provide instances from the training set where the hypothesis was accurate. Then, the LLM selects the most relevant hypothesis by comparing the test example to these training examples and evaluating their similarity.\nThereafter, we apply the hypothesis to the test example to perform inference. Please note that this is all done in one step with a long prompt.\nTwo-step adaptive inference.\nWe divide the previous inference strategy into two steps:\nThe LLM determines the most relevant set of examples by comparing the test example with the corresponding examples of the hypotheses.\nThen, the corresponding hypothesis is provided to the LLM, which it uses to perform inference on the test example in a second prompt."

We thus only use the headlines for our dataset.\nThis process resulted in a total of 150,816 headlines across 22,666 packages.\nWe construct a binary classification dataset by choosing for each package the headline that received the most clicks and the one that received the fewest.\nWe remove all sets of duplicate headlines, which results in our version of the ataset.\nThe task for this dataset is to deduce which headline had more clicks in a pair.\nTweet popularity uses a dataset of 13,174 tweet pairs (Tan et al., 2014  ###reference_b29###), which are matched by the topic and the author.\nSimilar to  the task is to predict which one received more retweets."

Moreover, HypoGeniC is 12.8% and 11.2% better than RoBERTa on nd Tweet popularity respectively with 200 training examples.\nSince RoBERTa learns by updating model weights to minimize the cross-entropy loss, it tends to benefit from more training examples, so we increase training examples to 1000 for RoBERTa.\nDespite the accuracy boost from more training examples, we find that HypoGeniC\u2019s best result still outperforms RoBERTa by 3.7% on nd 0.7% on Tweet popularity.\nOne exception, however, is the Deceptive reviews dataset.\nWe suspect that as word-level features are very useful in this dataset (Ott et al., 2011  ###reference_b21###),\nthey could be tougher for LLMs to extract but easier for fine-tuned models to grasp.\nUpdating hypothesis bank leads to hypotheses of higher quality.\nComparing HypoGeniC with the \u201cno updates\u201d results, we find that updating hypotheses generally leads to better hypotheses, suggesting that our algorithm is effective at improving hypothesis quality.\nThe improvement is on average 0.7% on Shoe sales, 5.8% on Deceptive reviews, 8.1% on  and 7% on Tweet popularity.\nAnother advantage of HypoGeniC over \u201cno updates\u201d is that sometimes the training examples exceed the context window size of LLMs, which can lead to degraded performance (Figures 4  ###reference_### and 3  ###reference_###).\nEffect of inference strategy.\nFigure 2  ###reference_### shows HypoGeniC results with different inference strategies on Deceptive reviews.\nSingle-step adaptive inference\nis the most effective.\nGenerally, we find that hypotheses to be one-sided, focusing on either characteristics of truthful or deceptive reviews.\nWe thus need to consider more than one hypothesis to make a correct prediction, so best-accuracy hypothesis or two-step adaptive inference would not be ideal for this dataset.\nOn the other datasets, we find that the effect of inference strategy is much smaller.\nBest-accuracy hypothesis is sufficient for Shoe sales and  and filter and weighted vote works best for Tweet popularity.\nResults for all datasets are in \u00a7 C.1  ###reference_###.\nWhichever inference strategy we use, the trend of HypoGeniC against few-shot learning and RoBERTa remains largely the same.\nGenerally, having more training examples and a larger hypothesis pool improves performance.\nWe show performance for different methods as number of training examples increase in Figures 4  ###reference_###, 3  ###reference_### and 5  ###reference_###.\nWe find HypoGeniC accuracy steadily increases as training size increases on Shoe sales, suggesting that an LLM is more likely to generate the best hypothesis given more examples.\nFor the real-world datasets, however, the performance sometimes peaks at training size at 25 or 100 before reaching to 200.\nWe suspect that the evaluation of the hypothesis bank would be less stable for the real-world datasets, since more than one correct hypotheses are needed for the task.\nWe also find that using a hypothesis pool of size 20 leads to better performance than using a pool of size 3.\n###figure_2###"

With HypoGeniC, we are not only are able to generate human-interpretable hypotheses but also achieve better predictive performance against competitive baselines and even oracles. Furthermore, our method can generalize well with different models and datasets, including open models. Notably, with our generated hypotheses, we uncover new insights in real-world tasks that are widely studied in social sciences.\nHypoGeniC can be directly applied to natural language related tasks in social sciences.\nWe encourage future work to explore hypothesis generation that requires additional modalities and/or leverages existing literature."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\n\nThe paper is motivated by the need to enhance and assist the hypothesis generation process in scientific research, which traditionally relies on the creativity and intuition of individual researchers. Despite advancements in sciences, there's a noted asymmetry where extensive formal and empirical evaluation of hypotheses is presented in scientific publications, while the generation of these hypotheses often happens informally and off-stage. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs), the authors aim to explore their potential in aiding this crucial but often opaque aspect of scientific inquiry.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe main question the paper tackles is how to enable LLMs to generate high-quality hypotheses based on data\u2014a common approach in empirical sciences. Specifically, the authors address two key challenges:\n1. The difficulty for LLMs to effectively leverage input examples when provided in a single long prompt.\n2. The need for measures of quality during the hypothesis generation process to filter out weaker hypotheses and refine better ones.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\nThe authors build on various streams of previous research:\n1. The hypothesis on scaling laws in language modeling that has inspired recent progress in large language models, as described by Chowdhery et al. (2022).\n2. The creative process of hypothesis generation, citing historical examples like Kekul\u00e9\u2019s \"hallucination\" of the benzene molecule structure (Rothenberg, 1995).\n3. The upper confidence bound algorithm from multi-armed bandit problems, adapted here to guide the exploration and exploitation tradeoff in hypothesis generation (Auer, 2002).\n\nRecent studies relevant to hypothesis generation using LLMs are also discussed:\n- Qiu et al. (2024) examined the ability of LLMs to perform human-like induction reasoning.\n- Zhong et al. (2023) aimed to support open-ended exploration in scientific inquiry.\n\nThese pieces of prior work explore the broader task of hypothesis generation but do not focus on the specific challenge of generating robust, interpretable hypotheses for empirical problems\u2014a gap this paper aims to fill.\n\n### Contributions\n\nThe paper proposes a novel computational framework inspired by multi-armed bandit algorithms for generating and evaluating hypotheses with LLMs. The contributions include:\n- Enabling the generation of interpretable hypothesis-based classifiers that outperform traditional few-shot and supervised learning methods.\n- Demonstrating robustness of the hypotheses across different LLMs and out-of-distribution datasets.\n- Providing qualitative insights, where the generated hypotheses corroborate existing theories and offer new perspectives for further research, particularly in fields like deception detection and message popularity prediction.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology: Hypothesis Generation with Large Language Models \n\nWe begin with a description of the problem formulation. Given a set \\({(x_i, y_i)}\\) where \\(x_i\\) is an example and \\(y_i\\) is the corresponding label, the goal is to learn a set of hypotheses \\(H\\) that describe theories of relationships between \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\).\n\nTo this end, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) to summarize demonstration examples into high-level hypotheses (\u00a7 2.1). Specifically, this involves providing the LLM with a series of example pairs \\((x_i, y_i)\\), from which it generates hypotheses that encapsulate the underlying patterns or relationships.\n\nThen, during inference, the LLL makes predictions based on the generated hypotheses (\u00a7 2.2). In this phase, the LLM uses the previously generated hypotheses to make inferences on new, unseen data \\((x_j)\\).\n\nOur code is available at https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/hypothesis_generation.\n\n### Key Components and Innovations:\n1. **Problem Formulation**: Structuring the problem as the learning of relationship theories between example \\((x_i)\\) and label \\((y_i)\\).\n2. **Hypothesis Prompting**: Leveraging a Large Language Model to synthesize high-level hypotheses from example pairs.\n3. **Inference Mechanism**: Utilizing generated hypotheses to drive the inference process on new data.",
