We name our system after Polaris, a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Minor, currently designated as the North Star., the first safety-focused Large Language Model (LLM) constellation for real-time patient-AI healthcare conversations. Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare, which focus on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multi-billion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging patient-friendly conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses, social workers, and nutritionists to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives.",

(2023  ###reference_b2###), and intelligent content creation Ray (2023  ###reference_b3###). The scaling of LLMs and the datasets used to train them, together with new architectural advances has contributed greatly to the advances in AI capabilities, and shown to surpass human performance in various benchmark tasks sur  ###reference_b4###. These new capabilities are enabling real-world applications that were impossible until very recently such as those in healthcare.\nHealthcare specialization. Amidst the several domains and applications, healthcare remains a high-stake domain where errors may have fatal implications. The advent of GPT-4 Achiam et al. (2023  ###reference_b5###) has led to a profound surge in the use of AI for healthcare applications, including clinical note and electronic health record processing (see Lee et al. (2023  ###reference_b6###) for overview). While systems like MedPALM Singhal et al. (2023a  ###reference_b7###) and GPT-4 have shown impressive results in general medical benchmarks like USMLE, recent work shows significant error rate for more specialized use-cases like pediatrics Barile et al. (2024  ###reference_b8###). Among the failures, researchers observe that the AI systems struggle to spot known relationships between conditions that an experienced physician would look for, e.g., for a patient with autism, a physician might check for dietary deficiencies.  Jacobsen and DeNiro (2017  ###reference_b9###).\nThe researchers note that these systems could be improved by selectively training on accurate and high quality medical literature, not just general articles over the internet, which are typically what most LLMs are trained on. Furthermore, it is possible that the base knowledge about autism leading to nutrient deficiencies is present in the LLMs; what is missing is the medical reasoning to connect the dots (i.e., some patients with autism exhibit narrow dietary preferences, which can then lead to nutrient deficiencies).\nConversational Healthcare Systems. Most of the existing works for generative AI in healthcare are focused on tasks like medical question-answering Singhal et al. (2023b  ###reference_b10###) and EHR summarization Veen et al. (2024  ###reference_b11###). There are very few works focusing on natural dialogue between caregivers and patients. More recently, Tu et al. developed Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) Tu et al. (2024a  ###reference_b12###), which outlines the importance of diagnostic dialogue to enable physicians to make diagnoses and develop management plans. AMIE is presented as a tool for physicians, and focused on diagnostic use cases. There remains a gap in work addressing the broader range of conversations between a care team and a patient that are neither diagnostic, nor directed to clinical decision making, such as inquiring whether a patient is adhering to their prescription, whether they are following the physician\u2019s pre- and post-procedure directions, and general wellness check-ins. While non-diagnostic, these conversations must still be medically accurate, and critically, must build rapport and trust with the patient to make them feel safe, supported, and confident in their care, while communicating with empathy and bedside manner. Such relationship has shown to lead to better patient satisfaction and, ultimately, better outcomes in real world Derksen et al. (2013  ###reference_b13###). General-purpose LLM\u2019s, however, are not optimized for such objectives. Furthermore, these LLM\u2019s are also not optimized for real-time, voice-based conversations, which can be quite different from text-based conversations. For instance, factors such as response length, quality of voice, pauses and interrupts greatly impact the subjective experience.\nThe case for AI-based Healthcare Agents. The US healthcare industry is facing a massive shortage of healthcare workers, that became even more apparent after the COVID-19 pandemic ora  ###reference_b14###. Exacerbated by burnout, stress and financial conditions, 16.7% of hospitals anticipated a critical staffing shortage in 2023 according to the Department of Health and Human Service AHA  ###reference_b15###. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the need to fill over 200,000 nursing positions every year until 2031 Fac  ###reference_b16###. A 2023 survey found that 28.7% percent of nurses were considering to leave their jobs. The trend in the decline of the US workforce indicates a shortage of more than 4 million workers nationwide by 2026 ora  ###reference_b14###. In the meantime, the demand for healthcare continues to grow as the population continues to age. There are currently 46 million adults over 65, and it will increase to 64 million by 2030, and 90 million by 2050 Agi  ###reference_b17###.\nGiven this massive gap in supply and demand for healthcare workers, and the recent promise of Generative AI to supercharge productivity, we focus on developing a non-diagnostic technology for healthcare workforce augmentation, which we denote as super-staffing. In this work, we develop autonomous generative AI healthcare agents that can safely converse with patients on medical topics. Our goal is to improve patient healthcare outcomes by providing a scalable and safe system that can handle non-diagnostic communications. Such a system will allow the human healthcare providers to focus on top-of-license diagnostic and clinical tasks, thereby helping to alleviate staffing shortages. The agents are designed with built-in safety guardrails that ensure appropriate human supervision.\nOur solution is a multi-agent system with highly specialized healthcare LLMs. The following are the primary contributions of our work.\nArchitecture and Training. We develop a unique multi-agent LLM constellation architecture optimized for real-time healthcare conversation. We employ a primary conversational agent with several specialist support agents for a patient-friendly and medically accurate conversation. The primary agent is trained to be aligned with nurse-like conversations geared for building trust, rapport and empathy with patients, as well as accomplishing healthcare-specific tasks typically performed by nurses, medical assistants, social workers, and nutritionists. We develop techniques to make the primary agent stateful to navigate through a long checklist of care protocols. Our support agents are specialized in healthcare tasks that require a high-level of accuracy, such as confirming that the patient\u2019s reported medicine consumption aligns with the dosage prescribed by their physician, determining whether the patient\u2019s reported OTC drug consumption is within the manufacturer\u2019s recommended range, understanding which medicine the patient is referring to (i.e., patients often struggle with correctly pronouncing drug names, and may confuse ones that sound similar), retrieving current and historical lab results from the patient\u2019s EHR, guiding the patient\u2019s food choices to align with their prescribed diet, etc. The specialist agents provide the relevant context to the primary agent in a message-passing framework, which drives the main conversation. To this end, we develop custom training protocols for conversational alignment using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones using patient actors and nurses (U.S. licensed) with agents- and clinicians-in-the-loop for co-operative learning.\nSafety. We adopt a three-pronged approach to safety comprised of: (1) A 70B-100B primary model trained using evidence based content; (2) a novel constellation architecture with multiple models totaling over one trillion parameters, in which a primary LLM is supervised by multiple specialist support models to improve medical accuracy and substantially reduce hallucinations; (3) built-in guardrails that bring in a human supervisor when necessary.\nEvaluation. To the best of our knowledge, we perform the first extensive real-world evaluation of a healthcare LLM system in which we recruited over 1100 US-licensed nurses and over 130 U.S.-licensed physicians posing as patients for our system. This is focused on an integrated system-level conversational evaluation on dimensions such as medical safety, readiness and bedside manners where we demonstrate parity with human nurses on several key metrics. We also perform a challenging component-level evaluation where we demonstrate that our medium-size specialized agents massively outperform a much larger state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) on the healthcare tasks as well as outperform an LLM from its own parameter size class (LLaMA-2 70B)."

            "text": "We develop Polaris for patient-facing, real-time healthcare conversation. The objective of this system is to perform low risk non-diagnostic tasks typically performed by nurses, medical assistants, social workers, and nutritionists. The system is constructed for voice-based interaction, as phone calls are the dominant method of communication for many high-volume and high-value healthcare use cases. Building a voice-based autonomous agent is a challenging problem due to factors such as voice quality, pitch, tone, response length, interruptions, and communication delay. Additionally, Polaris has to take into account errors introduced by the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system in the transcription of the audio signal, with a particular focus on the complexity of recognizing healthcare-specific words and phrases (e.g., complex medication names and lab values).\nWe train our healthcare agents to accomplish a number of tasks that can be completed via phone calls or voice-only interactions. Typical objectives for these tasks include general check-in on patient wellness, reviewing compliance with prescribed medicine regimes, confirming appointment details, reviewing procedural logistics, performing diet reviews, communicating lab results, etc. Given that the number of tasks in a typical care protocol can be quite large and extensive, the agent must be able to maintain and update conversation state with each patient, ensuring that all tasks are completed. The task completion rate directly impacts the success rate for the call. At the same time, we train these agents to have natural conversations that mimic what human caregivers would say, rather than a mere question-answering system as in prior works. For instance, the agent must be able to answer any question the patients may have, address their concerns, and otherwise handle tangential discussions in the conversation. This makes it particularly challenging for the agent to engage in deep conversations with the patient, given that the style, tone and content of these conversations can be quite different from the model\u2019s original training dataset. Such conversation fluidity coupled with its state awareness and medical accuracy remains at the crux of all our design and architectural decisions. Furthermore, we design our system to build trust and rapport with patients, learning about their personality and preferences to demonstrate good bedside manner and leading to higher patient satisfaction and potentially better health outcomes.\nOur system is deeply specialized in many different medical conditions and procedures. For the purpose of this report, we highlight three representative outbound-call use cases including follow-up calls for post-discharge congestive heart failure (CHF), ongoing care for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pre-operative check-in for colonoscopy. Figure 2  ###reference_### shows an overview of the different capabilities of our system."

            "text": "###figure_4### The core part of Polaris is the multi-agent LLM constellation. As opposed to a general large model performing many different tasks with varying performance, we break down the faculty into medium-size specialist models with consistent high performance. This is beneficial in settings like ours to optimize for tasks with competing objectives, while keeping the latency low for a real-time application. For instance, this allows us to optimize the primary language model for conversational fluidity, rapport-building and empathetic bedside manner with patients.\nSimultaneously, we focus on developing specialized agents with capabilities that serve a dual purpose: (a) assist the main LLM with relevant healthcare-specific context (e.g., A patient with chronic kidney disease stage 3b is recommended to avoid common NSAIDs like advil, motrin); (b) provide a layer of safety to double-check the information provided by the main model (e.g., 40mg of Lasix twice a day vs. 80mg of Lasix once a day). Each of these agents is tied to specific abilities such as confirming that the patient\u2019s reported medicine consumption aligns with the dosage prescribed by their physician, determining whether the patient\u2019s reported OTC drug consumption is within the manufacturer\u2019s recommended range, understanding which medicine the patient is referring to (i.e., patients often struggle with correctly pronouncing drug names, and may confuse ones that sound similar) retrieving current and historical lab results from the patient\u2019s EHR, guiding the patient\u2019s food choices to align with their prescribed diet, etc.\nWhile Polaris has many such agents, we focus on only a subset of them for illustration. Finally, these agents co-operate to solve a complex task. For instance, the patient utterance \u2018\u2018I am taking dulaglutide. I saw my hemoglobin a1c was 5 - is that normal?\u2019\u2019 requires both the lab agent and the medication agent to work together with the primary agent to formulate the response \u2018\u2018a hemoglobin a1c of 5 is within the normal range and lower than your previous value of 6.5. Your dulaglutide does decrease your hemoglobin a1c level\u2019\u2019.\nSafety Benefits. The constellation architecture offers many safety benefits, one of the most significant being the enhancement of safety through increased redundancy and specialization. Each safety-critical task is performed by co-operation between the primary model and the corresponding specialist agents. This redundancy ensures that if the primary model fails or misses a task for any reason, the specialist agent ensures that the system continues to operate correctly and safely.\nAnother key advantage of the constellation architecture is the modular design which facilitates ease of maintenance and enables continuous system improvements. This modular structure allows for individual specialist agents to be updated, repaired, or replaced without disrupting the entire system. This not only simplifies maintenance but also accelerates the process of rolling out updates, thereby ensuring that Polaris is always equipped with the latest features and security measures. Continuously upgrading the modules further enhances the safety of Polaris , as it allows for swift responses to newly discovered issues as they arise. This is particularly important in the clinical domain where we can update the specialist modules with new information and knowledge about drugs, interactions, policies and protocols without requiring to retrain the entire system.\nSystem architecture. Real-time conversations are especially sensitive to system latency including ASR, LLMs and TTS. The LLM constellation architecture also helps reduce end-to-end latency by allowing all the agents in Polaris to run concurrently, including the primary agent. The support agents can either be synchronous or asynchronous with respect to the primary agent\u2019s activity. The synchronous setting is used when the primary agent\u2019s response must be conditioned on the context provided by the support agent, for instance, in the case a retrieval agent detects the need for a database lookup to provide relevant information for the query \u2013 resulting in a higher latency. However, the average latency is lower since the support agents need not be invoked for every user utterance.\nIn the asynchronous setting, certain agent functionalities will not block the primary agent, but their results (contexts) will be made available to condition the primary agent response in a subsequent turn, once the asynchronous agent has completed its task. Polaris also implements a form of \u2018garbage collection\u2019 on the support agent\u2019s messages to the primary agent. The system removes stale tasks in order to not overburden the primary agent with outdated instructions not relevant at the current timestep. Finally, the constellation is pre-emptible with respect to new user utterance. The input is processed immediately after the system detects an end to voice activity, not relying on any explicit signal from the user. However, if additional speech is detected, constellation processes are restarted to use the updated information.\nFrom a systems perspective the constellation paradigm is extremely helpful for keeping latency low while still achieving robust multifaceted reasoning. Furthermore, each agent can be trained, updated and deployed independently. The modular paradigm allows for the model(s) in each agent to be customized and even switched for models of different sizes and runtime settings (e.g. quantization, temperature, sampling parameters, etc.) without affecting other models in the constellation. The agents are also trained to emit structured outputs, which are parsed by the code harness of Polaris to execute verifiable control flows, reduce hallucinations and ensure a consistent interface with the primary agent. While this system allows for efficiency through sparse activation of agents and a reduction of average latency, it also creates additional challenges. These include (a) false positives in the support agent event detectors that introduce noise to the primary agent; (b) resolving inter-agent conflicts where multiple agents can potentially introduce conflicting tasks; and (c) added complexity when tuning the primary agent to resolve and follow relevant support agent-provided tasks. We discuss our mitigation efforts for these in subsequent sections."

To explain this more clearly we adopt the following notation for the system components:\nAgents: Let  be the set of agents, where  is the primary agent and  are the support agents.\nConversation History: Let  be the conversation history up to turn , where  is the user utterance and  is the response of the primary agent at turn .\nAgent-Specific Prompts: Let  be the prompt for agent  at turn , derived from the conversation history .\nSupport Agent Outputs: Let  be the output of support agent  given prompt .

The state changes based on the outputs of the support agents, i.e., .\nPrompts: The prompt for the primary agent at turn  is a function of the updated state and the conversation history, i.e., .\nShort-Horizon Tasks: These can be represented as additional prompt snippets, e.g., , which are appended to the primary agent\u2019s prompt based on the state changes.\nPolaris mediates the message passing between agents with deterministic imperative programming. This allows us to keep the output space of the support agents well-constrained and implement control-flow logic to support customized protocols. The tasks which are given to the primary agent are systematically formatted and use synthesized information from multiple agents when applicable. This framework facilitates a cooperative approach to complex dialogue generation, where multiple agents contribute to the overall conversation dynamics.

As a result, we employ a diverse set of LLMs for the support agents ranging from 50B to 100B parameters, whereas the primary agent is always a medium-size LLM (70B - 100B parameters). All of our models follow a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, and contain between 30 and 100 layers. We use Grouped Query Attention (GQA) Ainslie et al. (2023  ###reference_b18###) to achieve faster inference speeds and reduced memory footprint when storing the KV cache during inference, which in turns allows us to serve larger batch sizes for increased throughput. Different models use different tokenizers depending on the use case and the need for specialized medical terminologies (such as drug names), with vocabulary sizes ranging from 30,000 to 200,000 tokens. The implementation of the attention mechanism employs Flash Attention 2 Dao (2023  ###reference_b19###), which makes the training and inference stages faster, with lower memory footprint and more efficient scaling to longer sequence lengths. All of our models use RMSNorm normalization layers Zhang and Sennrich (2019  ###reference_b20###), SwiGLU activation functions Shazeer (2020  ###reference_b21###), and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) Su et al.

            "text": "The nature of our conversational objectives requires specialized data. The agent should be able to maintain conversational state over relatively large time horizon; a multi-turn call in our setting often exceeds  minutes with several dozen turns from each speaker. It is important to generate data which portrays tougher trajectories within the healthcare setting of our calls. Our system must be robust to handling patients with diverse profiles, for instance, high engagement with many questions or concerns; low regimen compliance; skepticism of AI health services, etc.\nWe thus rely on the domain expertise of medical professionals, US-licensed nurses in our setting, to generate accurate data which exhibits comprehensive coverage of our desired data distribution. We leverage a large number of registered nurses, patient actors and our AI-in-the-loop to generate simulated conversations. For targeted medical conditions (e.g., CHF, CKD) and procedures (e.g., post-discharge, pre-operative, chronic-care followups), clinicians create conversational scripts (refer to Table 3  ###reference_### for a simplified version of our CHF script). We also create a large number of fictional patient profiles with different medical histories, condition severity, medications, labs, lifestyle and personality traits (refer to Table4  ###reference_### for a sample patient profile).\nThis call is a routine CHF Assessment\nVerify the patient\u2019s identity - First name, Last name, DOB\nReview the patient\u2019s current medications (new + old, excluding discontinued) with the patient, including dosage\nReview patient\u2019s diet, educate the patient on following low sodium diet and fluid restriction if necessary\nAsk the patient if they have any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\nAsk the patient if they have any ongoing or worsening chest pain\nAsk the patient if they have any new or worsening dry cough\nAsk the patient if they have increased swelling in their feet, ankle, stomach or legs\nAsk the patient to weigh themselves daily\nIf they weigh themselves regularly, ask the patient if they have gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week.\nAsk the patient if they are using more pillows at night to sleep\nInform the patient that we just performed a simple CHF assessment and encourage them to do it at home every day\nAsk the patient about physical activity and coach them to improve their routine if warranted\nWe require clinical expertise to train all parts of Polaris. In order to do this, we employ a bootstrapping strategy for data generation. Initially, we generate conversations using registered nurses and patient actors. We design these conversations to cover a wide breadth of scenarios and behaviors on the part of the simulated patient. We give specific instructions to patient actors to converse such that many of the specialist agents are triggered, such as asking complex questions about medications, mispronouncing medicine names, providing deliberately confusing lab results (e.g., a blood glucose reading in response to a request for their blood pressure reading), asking about hospital specific information (e.g., where to park), etc. During these conversations the registered nurse annotates the transcripts for when these events occurred and what the specialist agents should do during corresponding turns.\nWe then proceed to train both the primary and support agents from this collection of datasets. This allows us to start using our trained agents in the conversation instead of nurses; their responses are reviewed by registered nurses with potential re-writes for the noisy turns. We also employ instruction tuned language models to perform data cleaning and augmentation. This is used to improve the style of responses and also create additional variety, preventing mode collapse in the primary agent distribution and ensuring robustness in the support agents. Like most bootstrapping situations, this process becomes more effective with more rounds of training, which allows generalization to new scripts, medications, and so on.\nName: Mary Adams; DOB: 1950-01-01; Gender: Female; Condition: Congestive Heart Failure\nLasix 20 mg oral tablet;\nPotassium 20 milliequivalent oral tablet;\nLisinopril 10 mg oral tablet;\nTylenol 500 mg oral tablet\ninr: 1.0;\nglucose: 143.0 mg/dL;\nhemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL;\nhematocrit: 29 %;\nwbc: 5.0 x/L;\nplatelets: 231.0 x/L;\nmcv: 81 fL;\npcv: 0.48 fL;\nred blood cell count: 4.1 x;\nmch: 28.0 pg\nHere we provide more details on the entities which participate in the data generation process.\nPatient Actors. Here the actors are asked to play the role of a fictional patient and portray a realistic patient experience. They are encouraged to use the fictional patient\u2019s background as well as their personal experiences and feelings to guide them. We provide them with sample instructions, for instance: Ask about lab values - what they mean, whether they\u2019re normal or not; state they\u2019re taking the wrong medication dosages, or that they are taking medications not on their chart, and so on.\nRegistered Nurses. We ask the nurses to play the role of an ideal nurse at the bedside, on the phone, or in their community. While we provide them with the conversational script with defined call objectives, they are encouraged not to follow the order strictly, but instead follow the natural conversation trajectory for a realistic experience. This allows the patient at times to go on tangents, for instance, sharing their personal experiences that the nurse can engage with to develop rapport and trust; share their health concerns and symptoms that the nurse can both empathize with and educate on.\nOur AI-in-the-Loop. Once our models are tuned with conversations generated from the earlier phases, we further use them to generate synthetic conversations. Here, the AI plays the role of a nurse with the conversational script and meta instructions used in the prompt as a preamble to converse with the patient actors. This stage is required primarily for tuning our support agents (discussed in Section 7  ###reference_###) that generate tasks and provide relevant context to condition the primary agent to generate the response. After our support agent system is sufficiently tuned, we proceed to RLHF data generation. For this we sample multiple responses from the primary agent for the full prompt constructed from the meta-prompt, conversation history and support agent tasks. We leverage our registered nurses to give preference feedback to perform RLHF on the primary agent."

Most instruction tuning regimes involve single or few-turn interactions between the user and assistant. In our case, most calls consist of several dozen turns from each call participant. We convert a conversation with  turns from each participant into  training data points, where for each , we create a prompt with the conversation history up to turn  with meta-instructions in the preamble, mask the prompt, and train the primary agent to predict the content of the nurse turn . We apply a standard cross-entropy next-token loss objective for this supervised training.\nA standard practice for language model training on multi-turn conversation consists of applying loss masks to all of the user turns and training on all of the assistant turns within a single training data point. This approach has the benefit of increased training compute efficiency when compared to splitting up all of the turns into individual training data points as we do. However, in our case this approach is not applicable because we expose a conversation state description  to the primary agent which evolves as a result of the other agents in the constellation system . Aside from the conversation history  growing turn by turn, the primary agent system prompt is changed due to the effect of the checklist specialist (see Section 4.2  ###reference_###). Furthermore, the other clinical specialist agents inject short-horizon tasks and instructions . These are placed with their own format, and expire based on heuristics inside of the task orchestration system. We thus create a separate prompt for each turn which is a function of  that has its loss masked, and we train only for the labeled response .\nFigure 33  ###reference_### shows selected dialogues between an anonymized nurse and patient, our approach grounds our healthcare agent in authenticity, drawn from real-world interactions.

Before we dive into the topics I have to cover, I\u2019d like to get to know you a little better. Is there anything you\u2019re looking forward to doing this week? \nPatient: Actually, yes! I am looking forward to a little gardening. Its something I love and it\u2019s very relaxing for me. \nAgent: That sounds wonderful, George! Gardening can indeed be very therapeutic. What kind of plants do you usually tend to in your garden? \nPatient: I enjoy growing a mix of things. Vegetables, herbs, and a few flowers. It\u2019s nice to grow my own healthy food and see everything come to life. \nAgent: That\u2019s fantastic! Growing your own food can be so rewarding. What\u2019s your favorite vegetable or herb to grow? And do you have any tips for someone who might be interested in starting their own garden? \nPatient: My favorite herb is basil. It\u2019s versatile and grows pretty easily. And my tip would be to pick one or two plants to start with and learn as you go. Gardening is a process of trial and error, so don\u2019t get discouraged. \nAgent: Basil is indeed a wonderful herb to grow and use in cooking. And thank you for the gardening tip. Starting small and learning as you go sounds like a wise approach. Do you use your home-grown basil in any special recipes? \nPatient: Yeah, I use it in homemade pesto and toss it into pastas and salads. \nAgent: Homemade pesto sounds delicious, and it\u2019s a great way to incorporate fresh herbs into your meals. Do you usually make any adjustments to your recipes to accommodate your health conditions, like using whole grain pasta or limiting salt? \nPatient: I do try to stay healthy by using whole grain pasta and keeping an eye on salt. \nAgent: That\u2019s a great approach, George. Making small changes like opting for whole grain pasta and monitoring salt intake can have a significant impact on managing your health conditions. Now, before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, do you have any symptoms or health concerns you\u2019d like to share with me? \nPatient: No specific concerns, I\u2019m managing quite well right now. \nAgent: I\u2019m relieved to hear that you\u2019re managing well. Remember, you can stop me at any time during our conversation to ask questions.\nPatient: Most days. Not every day, but most days.\nAgent: I\u2019m relieved to hear that you\u2019re keeping an eye on your blood sugar levels. It\u2019s a key part of managing your diabetes. Can you recall what your most recent blood sugar reading was?\nPatient: You know, I\u2019m a little embarrassed to say it was a hundred and thirty eight.\nAgent: No need to feel embarrassed, Mr. Hernandez. We\u2019re all human and it\u2019s perfectly fine to have off days. Can you recall if you took this reading before eating or after you had a meal?\nPatient: I took it actually before I ate anything.\nAgent: I appreciate you letting me know that. A fasting blood sugar level of one thirty-eight is slightly above the usual range, which is between sixty and one oh five. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as your diet, stress levels, or even the timing of your medication. Let\u2019s work together to figure out what might be causing this. Have you noticed any specific patterns or triggers that seem to affect your blood sugar levels?\nAgent Tuning:\nWe also perform specialized alignment or agent tuning focusing exclusively on clinician-patient dialogues in this step. This targeted training sharpens the model\u2019s proficiency in handling specific scenarios anticipated within our system\u2019s operational context. A significant aspect of this stage involves training the model to adeptly navigate and adhere to intricate checklists tailored to individual patient conditions and prescribed care protocols, where we give considerable attention to both medical and non-medical exchanges.\nDuring this phase, we engage in iterative co-training between the primary agent and support agents, where the primary agent is trained in tandem with support agents. The support agents are trained to pay attention to signals in the primary agent\u2019s conversation with the user. And conversely, the support agents communicate with the primary agent by modifying its prompt, and injecting relevant information and instructions.\nFigure 3  ###reference_###, Figure 4  ###reference_### and Figure 32  ###reference_### show excerpts from our simulated conversations between the patient actors and Polaris.\nAgent Tuning is the hardest part of the entire Conversation Agent training pipeline. It is quite challenging to train the constellation of the LLMs which communicate together with the primary agent. Figure 5  ###reference_### shows how conflicts can arise between various agents. In Figure 5  ###reference_###, the primary agent is provided with two tasks from the Lab & Vitals Agent, and the Human Intervention Agent. When multiple agents add a task for the primary agent to follow, the primary agent resolves the conflict by prioritizing the Human Intervention Agent and giving a safe and informative response to the patient. To train such a system we leverage actual physicians and nurses who label the data and assimilate the information from various agents to provide the most appropriate response to the patient.\nAgent: You\u2019re doing a great job managing your diabetes. Let\u2019s shift our focus to your blood pressure.Can you recall when you last checked it?\nPatient: Its 140 over 90.\nAgent: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to tell me about your blood pressure or any other health concerns?\nPatient: No. I went out to eat last night, and I had some miso soup, probably that\u2019s why its up.\n                   <Lab And Vitals Agent TASK>\nFor \u2019Systolic\u2019 The normal range for blood pressure is 90 to 120. The patient\u2019s systolic reading is a high.\nFor \u2019Diastolic\u2019 The normal range for blood pressure is 60 to 80. The patients diastolic reading is a high.\n                   <Human Intervention Agent TASK>\nTELL the patient you have taken a note of the patient\u2019s issue that the patient has high blood pressure and will let their care team know. \nAgent:\nOkay, Mr. Hernandez. It\u2019s not uncommon for certain foods, particularly those high in sodium like some miso soup, to cause a temporary rise in blood pressure. I\u2019ve made a note of this and will pass it along to your care team. Let\u2019s proceed to your recent lab results. Do you have any questions or concerns about them?\nSelf Training: A typical challenge with training the AI on simulated conversations is that of generalization. Even though we train our models on diverse scripts and conditions to cover a wide range of scenarios, it still suffers from exposure bias He et al. (2019  ###reference_b24###). This results in the AI producing similar responses in the conversation, increase in repetitions and lack of robustness to diverse scenarios it never encountered during training. This results from the way we instruction tune these models with next token prediction during training with teacher forcing: where the model produces the next token conditioned on ground-truth token in the previous step. However, during inference, there is no ground-truth and the model samples a token conditioned on self-predicted token in the previous step \u2013 creating a training and inference mismatch referred to as exposure bias. To address this, we train the AI on self-generated responses during training. To this end, we train the model for a few steps; use the current model parameters to produce responses on sampled training prompts with temperature sampling to augment the original training data; and then re-train the model. This ensures the model encounters diverse training samples in different iterations and also aware of its own uncertainties during sampling at inference \u2013 thereby minimizing the distribution shift."

Through this iterative process, we ensure the model\u2019s responses are not only accurate but also aligned with the nuanced requirements of empathetic patient care.\nWe gather preference data from the same pool of nurses that were involved in the conversation data generation. Nurses are presented with the overall context, the conversation history and any active tasks provided by the support agent system. They are then asked to rank multiple candidate responses in their order of preference. This is nontrivial as there are multiple factors that determine the quality of a response. We ask them to prioritize medical safety and accuracy above everything else. Given that, responses are judged for empathy, bedside manner, level of patient education, and other conversational features. Within this, we suggest heuristics for what would be considered \u2018acceptable\u2019 with regards to conversational fluency. If the nurse judges none of the responses to be acceptable, we ask them to write an ideal response. Importantly, the rewrite must still conform with the tasks given by the support agents in order to not break the cooperative nature of the constellation system. From the ranked responses we construct pairwise preference samples. We exclude pairs where the preferred response was deemed unacceptable. When there are available rewrites, we only create pairs where the rewrite is preferred and all model responses are not preferred."

The primary conversation agent is required to maintain a large context in order to achieve optimal conversational fluency, but much of this is irrelevant for the medical reasoning subroutines.

It\u2019s important to do this verification before any personal information on the patient is loaded into the LLM context to prevent any leaking of information. It is also paramount that the identity verification has an extremely low error rate and no hallucination. To protect patient privacy and comply with privacy rules, the system must verify that the person answering the call is the intended recipient, before engaging further. In order to do this, the Privacy & Compliance Specialist confirms identifiers including full name and one of date of birth or medical records number. This agent can easily be trained to verify additional identifiers as appropriate (e.g., authorized care manager, parent, etc.).\nUntil the recipient\u2019s identity has been confirmed, the system should not share such PHI with the recipient. However if the primary agent\u2019s prompt contains salient details of a patient\u2019s Electronic Health Records to support discussion of medications, lab values, etc., it is vulnerable to disclosing some of the information to the patient (e.g., by red teaming).\nOne solution is to use a higher-order state transition to ensure that the primary agent has no PHI in its context at all until the patient\u2019s identity has been verified. During the initial state, the primary agent requests to speak with the intended recipient. When the target recipient becomes available, the primary agent requests that the patient provide the required patient identifiers. During these first two stages, the primary agent does not have the correct DoB or MRN in its context. Therefore, to verify the patient-provided identifiers, the primary agent forwards them to a second component that checks these details against the protected database.\nIf the second agent finds that the identifiers are incorrect, it returns a non-PHI response specifying failure that prompts the primary agent to re-verify. After a few failed retries, the primary agent terminates the call. Once the second agent finds that the identifiers are correct, the main phase of the conversation begins. This is depicted by the transition from the yellow to purple regions of the diagram in Figure 6  ###reference_###. At this point, PHI such as EHR details are loaded into the primary agent\u2019s prompt.\n###figure_5###"

In order to have a natural flow of conversation, we allow the user to go on tangential discussions while accomplishing a particular task in the checklist. This makes it challenging to bring the conversation back and resume from the pending checklist items. To address this challenge, we devised the checklist specialist to guide through complex call objectives.\nTo make this tractable, we leverage synthetic scripts with ordering of tasks as part of a call specification. We then train an LLM specifically to assess the conversation state concurrently with the primary agent model. This support model determines which tasks have been completed and correspondingly updates an internal data structure. Changes in this data structure propagate into the prompt for the primary agent by discarding objectives that have been accomplished and popping from a queue of objectives that are pending. This mechanism thus acts as a form of higher-order attention. We find this to be highly effective in ensuring the primary agent achieves all of the pre-specified objectives, especially when the patient asks additional questions or goes off on a tangential discussion, not necessarily related to the objective in question. Furthermore, this system bounds the number of input tokens related to the tasks so that very long scripts e.g. comprehensive health questionnaires are still manageable.\nThe evaluation of states can be challenging when the individual tasks can be complex and multifaceted. For example, a simple task might be to confirm with the patient the date, time and location of their upcoming procedure. Once the agent states these details and the patient acknowledges they understand, then the task is complete. However, there are other, more involved tasks such as going over a patient\u2019s diet and giving appropriate guidance on it. In this scenario it is plausible that the primary agent gives substantial advice on typical breakfast, lunch and dinner and is ready to move on. However, the checklist specialist may not share this belief, creating a deadlock. We could choose to have both models decode chains-of-thought and perform reconciliation, but this and similar strategies break the latency constraints imposed in the voice-based setting for our system.\nInstead, we adopt a strategy of letting the primary agent decide when to move onto the next set of tasks as it deems appropriate. The checklist specialist is thus tasked with passively documenting the transitions rather than actively enforcing them. This removes the possibility of deadlock and also ensures the primary agent\u2019s conversation does not follow the scripts exactly verbatim, but allows for a natural flowing conversation. To further ease the role of the checklist specialist, we organize the scripts into sections, and prompt the specialist to assess whether the primary agent has moved from a given section to another one \u2013 where a section comprises of a set of related tasks and instructions. This allows us to manage states across long conversations with several complicated tasks. This specialist also plays a similar role during a potential human intervention scenario as there is a checklist describing primary agent protocol. Thus, it is technically the owner of the Intervention State Model depicted in Figure 22  ###reference_###. Finally, this agent also decides when to terminate the call as appropriate \u2013 a vital functionality for real-world scenarios."

It utilizes the datasets generated from simulated conversations to recognize a wide variety of medication names, including those that are mispronounced or less commonly known, and to understand the context of the conversation. The Detector is passively listening to the conversation between the primary agent and the patient\u2019s every turn and identifies the list of all medication names if discussed and the context of the conversation. The key challenge here is to make the detector robust enough to identify both correct and misspelled medication names without being overtly sensitive to false positives. To achieve this, the model is trained on a diverse dataset that includes a wide range of medication names, brand names, generic names, and common misspellings or phonetic variations. The output of the Medication Detector is a structured list of medications mentioned in the conversation, along with their associated context. This information is then passed to the Dosage Evaluator for further analysis of the patient\u2019s adherence and dosage safety.\nDosage Evaluator: The Dosage Evaluator focuses on analyzing the dosage and adherence patterns mentioned in conversations. It is fine-tuned to detect discrepancies between prescribed regimen and patient-reported usage, including errors in timing, strength, frequency, and quantity. The model is trained to use the structured information from the patient\u2019s EHR or Physician Approved Reference Tables as ground truth to identify potential issues with the reported dosages in the conversation by the patient. The model returns whether the dosage reported by the patient is CORRECT, HIGH or LOW with respect to the ground truth. The key challenge here is to develop a model that can accurately parse and interpret the often ambiguous and incomplete dosage information provided by patients in natural conversation. Patients may use colloquial terms or omit key details when discussing their medication usage. The Dosage Evaluator needs to be robust to this variability and be able to infer the intended meaning. To address this, the model is trained on a large corpus of simulated conversations that cover a wide range of dosage scenarios, including both compliant and non-compliant usage patterns.

Subsequently, this specific value is analyzed to deliver relevant feedback.

            "text": "General language models lack medical grounding of lab reference ranges and tend to get confused due to the different reference ranges on the internet. Identifying the correct reference range for a patient\u2019s lab value, given their age, gender, etc., is essential for accurate lab presentation and the avoidance of hallucination.\nUnderstanding and presenting the normal ranges for laboratory tests and vital signs is a common request from patients. The normal range refers to the set of values that includes the majority of results for healthy individuals. For instance, one might ask, \"Is a hematocrit level of 43 normal?\". This question seeks to ascertain whether the patient\u2019s hematocrit level falls within the expected range for healthy individuals. See Figure 13  ###reference_### for our system\u2019s response to this query.\nFor each lab, we also define a broader set of values that we term the plausible range. A patient reported lab outside of this range may be erroneous, and warrants clarification. For example, the normal range for systolic blood pressure is between 90 and 120 mmHg Whelton et al. (2018  ###reference_b27###) for the majority of healthy individuals. The plausible range extends from 60 to 250 mmHg Whelton et al. (2018  ###reference_b27###). This wider range acknowledges that values outside the normal can occur.\nIf a patient reports that her blood pressure is 125, the Labs & Vitals Specialist should first determine that the patient is referring to systolic blood pressure and that the associated value is 125. Following this identification, the specialist prepares feedback to supply the normal range information to the conversational agent. This feedback will also include a note indicating that the patient\u2019s blood pressure is above the normal range but still within the plausible range. By contrast, the agent should confirm a reading that is outside the plausible range. For example, if the patient reports a systolic blood pressure of 500, the conversation might include a plausibility check like, \"Your systolic blood pressure of 500 is not plausible. Did you accidentally make a mistake?\"\nIn addition, if a reported lab result or vital sign value falls outside the intervention reference range (e.g., if the reported blood pressure is 190), the Human Intervention Specialist will step in and decide whether the call needs to be transferred to a human nurse. This capability is designed to enhance patient safety."

Understanding of lab values over time is critical to understanding if patient is improving or degrading and essential for chronic care coaching. To address this challenge, this specialist agent links patient queries to existing information in the EHR and conditions some of its answers on patient records. For instance, if a patient asks, \"How\u2019s my A1C value of 5.6% compared to the previous measurement?\", the specialist retrieves and compares this latest result with prior entries (see Figure 14  ###reference_###). The Labs & Vitals Specialist then provides this information to the conversational agent to produce a contextualized response to the patient\u2019s query. This specialist can also supply information for all the labs or vitals in the patient\u2019s records when it receives a generic query. In addition, it provides trend analysis on a specific lab when multiple records of the same lab exist in the patient\u2019s file.

For example, hemoglobin levels can vary by gender, with males typically having higher levels than females Murphy (2014  ###reference_b28###). Similarly, the normal range for certain lab tests, such as Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), changes with age and should be interpreted accordingly Musso and Oreopoulos (2011  ###reference_b29###).\nSpecific medications can alter lab values, often through their mechanism of action and hence necessitate differential lab value analysis. General language models can overlook these medication-induced changes in lab values.\nFor example, dapagliflozin can cause glucosuria Komoroski et al. (2009  ###reference_b30###) and hence alters the assessment of a urinalysis. See Figure 15  ###reference_### for another example.

When it detects references to medical labs or vitals in patient utterances, the specialist will then determine the specific labs and vitals that are relevant to the current context. It simultaneously extracts any associated values of the labs and vitals and reports all captured information to the system.\nUpon successfully identifying and extracting the pertinent labs and vitals information, the specialist proceeds to the next phase of its operation: analysis and response formulation. This involves consulting the patient\u2019s EHR to retrieve demographic information and medical history. Factors such as age and gender are essential in determining the appropriate normal range for many lab results and vitals, as these ranges can significantly vary for different populations. The specialist also assesses the plausibility of the reported value to help determine if there is a mistake on the patient\u2019s part.\nAdditionally, the specialist evaluates the impact of short-term conditional factors on the lab results. This includes considering the patient\u2019s recent medication intake and other relevant conditions, such as the timing of food consumption before a glucose test. Such information is vital for accurately determining whether the lab values fall within their expected ranges.\nIf the analysis reveals that additional information is needed\u2014for instance, clarification on whether a glucose measurement was taken fasting or after a meal\u2014the specialist initiates a follow-up query.

(2023  ###reference_b33###) is the process of optimizing the output of a Large Language Model (LLM) through referencing a knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output without the need to retrain or fine tune the model.\nOur Hospital & Payor Policy Specialist leverages RAG to have the ability to answer the latest policy related queries within the following categories: Payor Policies, Health System Policies, and Provider Policies.\nWe list below several compelling reasons for selecting RAG as the preferred approach over fine-tuning to address such latest policy related queries. Primarily, certain hospital policies undergo dynamic changes over time, for example, COVID-19 policies and the requirement for wearing masks during hospital visits. Maintaining the LLM model\u2019s currency through fine-tuning necessitates periodic, resource-intensive updates, incurring significant costs. In contrast, RAG presents a cost-effective alternative for keeping information up-to-date via updating the reference database.\nMoreover, a pivotal consideration in our system is the need to accommodate a multitude of hospitals, ranging from dozens to potentially hundreds or thousands of hospitals. Each hospital exhibits unique policy specifications, making it impractical and economically prohibitive to train or finetune individual LLMs for each hospital. However, our RAG can construct distinct reference vector databases for each hospital and leverage a singular LLM to achieve the purpose of serving multiple hospitals at the same time.\n###figure_9### As shown in Figure  18  ###reference_###, our RAG process encompasses three steps. The first step is RAG engine detection. This step is to identify whether the input query is related to a payor, health system, or provider policy. For a positive detection, the query is rewritten to indicate what hospital policy related question is being asked by the patient; otherwise remaining steps are skipped.\nThis step serves the dual purpose of reducing latency, as it avoids triggering a RAG reference database search for every query, which can be a computationally intensive process.\nThe second step is to calculate the similarity between the reformulated query and each pre-indexed chunk, and then retrieve top 3 most pertinent chunks.\nIn the final step, these three retrieved chunks are utilized as contextual input for the primary agent to facilitate the generation of the final response."

If so, it generate a simplified question; otherwise skips remaining steps. The generated simplified question will later be used as input to the retriever model.\nThe detector serves two primary purposes. Firstly, it addresses latency concerns, as it is imperative to minimize the response time of each agent. Blocking the primary agent to search the RAG vector database for every query can introduce undesirable delays, and the objective is to exclusively retrieve affirmative queries. Secondly, the detector functions as a query extractor, particularly important when patients may not explicitly articulate their queries.\nThe primary challenge encountered by the RAG detector lies in the extensive scope of hospital policies, encompassing approximately 11 major topics, each with numerous subtopics. Patients may also pose inquiries about the same subject using varied expressions and formats. Hence, our detector must exhibit robust capabilities to accurately discern these broad-topic questions and accommodate diverse questioning methods.\nAfter extensive experiments, we designed the detector to first generate the rewritten query and then predict the label based on the generated query, which can address the above challenge. We observe the rewritten query to serve as a chain of thought, which helps to improve the detection accuracy.\nPolicy Retriever: Upon obtaining the rewritten query generated by the detector, the retriever first transforms this reformulated query into an embedding. Subsequently, it calculates the similarity between this embedding and those of every text chunk in the vector database. The retriever then selectively returns the top three chunk texts with the highest similarity for the primary agent for generate the final response.\nIt is noteworthy to mention that since the retriever is fine-tuned on our indexed data, there is a notable enhancement not only in the retrieval performance for true positive queries from the RAG detector but also in the mitigation of the repercussions of false positives. This is attributed to the fact that false positive queries exhibit markedly low similarity with each indexed chunk text. Consequently, the retriever does not return any chunk text to the primary agent in such instances.\n###figure_10###"

Once the state model decides that all the necessary information has been obtained, the agent decides whether to transfer the call to a human nurse for further evaluation.\nPatient: \u201cI have this problem at work that is a pain in the neck.\u201d  No intervention required\nPatient: \u201cI\u2019m currently at work and my neck really hurts.\u201d  Possible intervention required\nThe overall architecture of the intervention agent is shown in Figure 22  ###reference_###. The architecture can be broken down into three separate stages: initial symptom detection, information gathering, and evaluation. In the first stage, we detect an initial symptom that could require further evaluation. In the second stage, our agent inserts the protocol questions into the main model\u2019s prompt, and the main model asks the questions while the state model decides whether all necessary information has been obtained. In the last stage, the agent decides whether an intervention is required.\n###figure_12### The symptom detection model runs at every turn and decides whether the patient shared a symptom that could require a human intervention. If the patient shares a relevant symptom, the system initiates the intervention protocol, comprised of a set of predefined follow-up questions. These questions allow us to obtain all the relevant information needed to determine whether the conversation should be escalated to a human.\nAfter the initial symptom has been detected and the necessary information has been obtained, the intervention agent must decide whether an intervention is necessary. If the model determines that an intervention is appropriate, the call will be transferred to a human. If no intervention is required, the main model will proceed with the rest of the conversation."

Further, we benchmark Polaris  against the performance of U.S. licensed human nurses on a set of fine-grained measures.\nOur evaluation approach focuses on both the overall subjective user experience, and targeted \u201cclinical capability validation\u201d - a focused assessment of certain tasks or functions relevant to healthcare conversations. For the overall subjective evaluation, we compare survey responses completed by users acting as patients following conversations with Polaris  to the same survey responses following conversations with human nurses. This comparison provides a subjective baseline that establishes the core conversational competence of our system.\nTo conduct a targeted assessment of certain non-diagnostic medical conversational capabilities, we devised a set of test cases corresponding to conversational scenarios that could arise in a healthcare setting. We tested our system versus a minimal configuration of competitor LMs in which they were directly presented with the same conversational challenge in isolation. For instance, instead of the primary conversational model drawing on the output of the \u201clabs and vitals\u201d specialist (as the primary agent does in our system), GPT-4 was solely responsible for commenting on user provided lab values. The objective of this assessment is to measure the importance and effectiveness of compartmentalizing complex tasks for a language model based AI system such as calculations, numerical comparisons, and critical and highly detailed subroutines such as medication reconciliation.\nOur baseline models rely on exactly the same infrastructure as our model for ASR, TTS (including the same synthetic voice) and telephony. Our goal is to isolate the experimental variability to the core healthcare knowledge and conversational ability of each model and our system. For these benchmarks we use the \u201cgpt-4-0613\u201d version of GPT-4."

            "text": "For the subjective evaluation, we recruited over 1100 US-licensed Registered Nurses (RNs) and over 130 US-licensed Physicians. After verifying their licenses, each participant had a series of conversations with our system.\nCalls were screened at this stage for quality - if their initial conversations were short (less than twenty turns, approximately four minutes), that user\u2019s evaluation was excluded from this analysis. Over 3,475 total conversations from these two groups were considered in the results for this section.\nParticipants were informed that they would be receiving calls from an AI Conversational agent that would be acting as a healthcare provider, that this system was still under active development, and that their calls would be recorded. All participants consented to having their anonymized conversational data used for research and product development purposes. They were given a set of \u201ccases\u201d: patient backgrounds and corresponding call scenarios, and were instructed to portray the patient accurately but also to draw on their own experiences interacting with patients to add detail and complexity to the call.\nIn addition to calls with our AI system, a subset of 60 nurses were randomly selected to also have conversations with a separate team of human nurses familiar with our call objectives. The nurses playing nurses in these calls were given the same patient background information as our AI system and the same set of call objectives. We did not evaluate the U.S. licensed human nurses by U.S. licensed physicians.\nWe chose to have nurses to act as patients in these calls to obtain expert-level focused assessments of the specific skills required for this type of interaction, such as motivational interviewing, clinical assessment and guidance offered by nurses (as opposed to physicians or other medical assistants). An individual nurse participant portrayed the patient role in a number of calls with our system; they were randomized to the human-to-human cohort and additional calls with a human nurse conducting the same call scenario.\nFollowing these conversations, each participant completed a survey focused on the following aspects of their experience: Bedside Manner, Conversation Quality, Clinical Readiness, Patient Education and Motivational Interviewing, and Medical Safety. Survey questions and answer choices were developed in collaboration with a team of experienced care-management nurses. Participants were also able to flag conversations as containing errors - all flagged calls were manually reviewed by our clinical team.\nFeatures\n\nNurses\nRated By\nNurses\n\nPolaris \n Rated By\nNurses\n\nPolaris \nRated By\nPhysicians\n\n\nDo you feel that the Nurse/AI listened to you?\n\n94.52%\n\n89.75%\n\n89.62%\n\n\nDid you feel that the Nurse/AI cared about you?\n\n89.77%\n\n88.15%\n\n86.84%\n\n\nDid you feel comfortable confiding in the Nurse/AI?\n\n88.81%\n\n88.93%\n\n88.45%\n\n\nDid the Nurse/AI get to know you as a person?\n\n57.58%\n\n78.43%\n\n74.71%\n\nBEDSIDE MANNER AVG\n82.67%\n86.32%\n84.91%\n\n\nHow would you rate this call on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best).\n\n8.04\n\n8.19\n\n7.86\n\n\nHow would you rate this call on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

            "text": "In addition to the overall subjective experience of interacting with our conversational system, we conducted a series of experiments to measure the ability of our conversational system, and competitor language models, to perform a variety of specific non-diagnostic healthcare tasks. These tasks were developed in conjunction with the same internal team of care-management nurses described above. We believe these capabilities represent core functionality required for an AI assistant to operate over the phone with any degree of independence.\nThe capability evaluation tasks were designated as belonging to one of two categories: \u201cconversational\u201d or \u201ciso-eval\u201d based on the complexity of the exchange required from the system to demonstrate a capability. Conversational tasks are more complex, often requiring many turns of back and forth between the patient and AI provider. For these tasks we developed a set of test cases consisting of fixed statements and follow-up instructions for our research nurses to enact while portraying the role of a patient in a series of telephone calls. A conversational evaluation task produces a set of call transcripts between the AI system and the nurse acting as a patient. Depending on the task, only a sub-section of the transcript may be relevant to the capability evaluation.\nIso-eval tasks correspond to capabilities that are simpler to demonstrate. Concretely they can be elicited reliably in a single turn: one question or statement from the simulated patient requires a response from the system that will demonstrate the skill. These capabilities are assessed using a set of \u201ccanned\u201d conversational snippets taken from real conversations between patient actors and human nurses from our internal research teams. Each snippet is modified by appending a final test turn - a statement or question from the patient that is meant to test a given capability. An iso-eval task produced a set of single-turn model responses (along with their corresponding conversational snippets).\nThe output of evaluation tasks of both categories, transcripts for conversational tasks and single-turn responses from iso-evals, were subsequently reviewed by nurses and clinicians for correctness against specified evaluation criteria. We explored automated evaluation for certain iso-eval tasks using a language model-based evaluator, but here we present only the results of human expert review.\nThe specific capability evaluations are described below:"

If the dosage is not correct, can the system determine whether it is high or low, if the frequency is correct or incorrect, and provide appropriate comment.\nIf a patient states they are taking a particular OTC medication or supplement, can the AI system determine whether this is recommended or not, based on the drug label, given their medical conditions\nIf a patient states they are taking a particular OTC medication or supplement including the amount they are taking, can the AI system determine whether this is within the recommended range, based on the drug label, given their medical conditions\nThese capabilities were evaluated using an \"iso-eval\" approach, which involved the use of fixed conversational snippets. The single-turn output of the three system configurations were then reviewed by a team of nurses.\nIn addition to these capabilities, we identified a common failure point for voice-based AI systems in healthcare: a patient may incorrectly state the name of a medication, forget the name entirely, or a transcription error may occur, leading to novel misspellings of common drug names or fragmentation of names into multiple smaller words. In such scenarios, we evaluated the AI system\u2019s ability to interact with the patient to accurately determine the intended drug name. This could involve the system asking the patient for clarification or requesting them to spell the name of the medication.\nTo evaluate this particular skill, we developed a set of potential mispronunciations or ambiguous or inaccurate ways to refer to a drug. These were then used by nurses in conversations with the AI systems. Subsequently, a separate team of nurses reviewed these interactions to assess the accuracy of the AI system\u2019s responses. The primary criterion for evaluation was whether the AI system was ultimately successful in identifying the correct drug name."

If there are multiple historical values which show a steady trend (e.g. \u201cdecreasing hemoglobin A1c\u201d or \u201cincreasing blood pressure\u201d over a year), can the AI system identify this trend and comment on it.\nAppropriately comment on the potential impact of certain medications and supplements on lab values (lab / medication interactions).

It further inquires about the specific discomfort or pain that led to Advil usage. GPT-4, on the other hand, acknowledges the patient\u2019s disclosure but only asks about the frequency and dosage of Advil to ensure safety with current medications, without specifically addressing the hypertension concern.\nFigure 25  ###reference_### presents a case where the patient with congestive heart failure and hypertension has started taking Zyrtec-D, an allergy medication that can increase blood pressure. Both our system and GPT-4 correctly note the potential impact on blood pressure and advise monitoring, demonstrating appropriate handling of this situation.\nThe dialogue in Figure 26  ###reference_### involves a patient accidentally taking double the prescribed dose of Lasix, a diuretic. Our system and GPT-4 both identify the incorrect dosage taken by the patient and respond appropriately by emphasizing the importance of taking the medication as prescribed and noting the potential consequences of the extra dose.\nFigure 27  ###reference_### showcases a case where the patient reports taking a high daily dose of 100 mg of the antihistamine Doxylamine. Our system recognizes that daily maximum dose greater than 75 mg is not recommended and correctly escalates this potential overdose to a human nurse for immediate assistance.

However, current advances in AI can directly aid in preventable human errors Bates et al. (2023  ###reference_b41###); CA (2022  ###reference_b42###) and therapeutic delays Newman-Toker et al. (2022  ###reference_b43###). Beyond the already existing challenges, bias in healthcare has been a well-known issue even before the integration of AI in healthcare Williams et al. (2010  ###reference_b44###); Fitzgerald and Hurst (2017  ###reference_b45###). This problem is far from solved, but there is a significant amount of effort from the community to recognize and mitigate it Marcelin et al. (2019  ###reference_b46###); Mccradden et al. (2020  ###reference_b47###). LLMs in healthcare still need considerable work Wornow et al. (2023  ###reference_b48###), requiring careful and safe implementation strategies."

In a study that monitored how physicians (across 4 US states) are spending time in administrative work and direct clinical face time, it was observed that Physicians could spend up to 49% of their time in electronic health records and desk work versus only 33 percent of the time on direct clinical face time with patients and staff Sinsky et al.

            "text": "Polaris  is an example of how LLM-based systems can be architected with real-time specialized conversation in mind. Some ongoing work items to improve the scope and versatility of our system include:\nOur goal is to produce superior health outcomes for users. To this end, multi-call settings provides an interesting avenue to establish and build connection with the user over time. This is also crucial to build rapport and trust. Here, information learned about the user in earlier calls is utilized to deliver more pleasant and medically constructive subsequent calls. This will require research into the best ways to incorporate prior call knowledge into the context of the primary agent. Given each call can be upwards of 20 minutes, this quickly approaches very large context sizes. This is especially valuable in the context of lifestyle factors which have an out-sized impact on health, such as dietary habits and smoking. Helping patients navigate these decisions given their real-world constraints requires connecting with them deeply and finding realistic solutions. Hence we aim to explicitly model the preferences of patients in future work to serve them most effectively. This direction requires research into real-world sample efficiency, planning with simulations, causal learning, exploration and more.\nIn this work we focused on the synchronous mode for our support agents. Recall this implies the primary agent\u2019s responses can be preempted if the support models want to inject new tasks at that same conversation turn. However, there is much to explore in the realm of agents which operate asynchronously in the background and do not block the lead agent\u2019s operation. Reasoning can be further enhanced by having LLMs constantly taking the state of the conversation and cross-referencing resources to look for medical corner-cases or extremely specific suggestions to give to the user. Consider the case of finding an ideal plan for medication affordability or interactions between many prescription medications and a patient\u2019s genetic profile. This can take varying amounts of time and resources, and so more complex orchestration patterns will need to be designed to support this behavior.\nPolaris  is composed of a set of LLMs plus orchestration and message passing infrastructure, situated between distinct ASR and TTS components. While we achieve quite impressive subjective experience scores, this can be further improved by multimodal modeling, which reduces the inherent information loss due to transcription and context-independent TTS. There are multitude of speech signals we are not currently incorporating such as pitch, prosody and emotional signatures. Audio-text multimodal fusion represents a promising opportunity for enhancing empathy and improving patient preference modeling. On the other side, having additional features fused into the TTS pipeline can enhance inflection, emphasis and ultimately create a more engaging and natural-sounding agent. Further, multimodal chain-of-thought and retrieval infrastructure can enhance our system."

            "text": "We developed a novel LLM constellation architecture, namely Polaris  with multiple specialized healthcare LLMs working in unison for real-time patient-AI voice conversations. Our architecture allowed for a primary agent to adopt a human-like conversational approach, exhibiting empathy and building rapport and trust; whereas the specialist agents were optimized for specific healthcare related tasks. We found this architecture allowed for accurate medical reasoning, fact-checking, and the avoidance of hallucinations, while maintaining a natural conversation with patients.\nWe performed extensive phase one and phase two testing of our system with U.S-licensed nurses and U.S.-licensed physicians. Impressively, on subjective criteria, our study participants rated our AI agent on par with U.S.-licensed nurses on multiple dimensions. On objective criteria, our medium-size AI agents significantly outperformed much larger general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 in medical accuracy and safety. We are now moving to phase three testing, which requires much more extensive evaluation to be completed by several thousands of licensed nurses and licensed physicians, as well as by our health system and digital health partners. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct such an extensive safety assessment of any Generative AI technology for real-life healthcare deployment.\nIn conclusion, we foresee a promising future for AI agents to improve healthcare by filling a large portion of the staffing gap. As we continue to push the boundaries and overcome challenges, our goal remains to provide scalable and safe systems that alleviate the burden on human health care providers and improve patient satisfaction, health care access, and health outcomes."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe motivation for this paper stems from the critical need in the healthcare domain to harness advanced AI systems to augment the workforce and improve patient outcomes. The increasing complexity of healthcare, coupled with a significant shortage of healthcare workers exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the necessity for innovative technological solutions. Additionally, the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in various tasks suggests their potential to significantly enhance healthcare services, particularly for non-diagnostic interactions between care teams and patients where building rapport and ensuring adherence to medical guidance are crucial.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe primary research problem addressed in the paper is the development of a scalable and safe AI system for healthcare workforce augmentation. Specifically, the authors aim to create autonomous generative AI healthcare agents capable of engaging in non-diagnostic conversations with patients. These agents are designed to perform tasks typically handled by nursing and support staff, thereby allowing human healthcare providers to focus on top-of-license work. The research aims to address gaps in existing solutions, particularly the need for AI systems that ensure medical accuracy, maintain patient trust and empathy, and are optimized for real-time, voice-based interactions.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\nThe paper builds on a substantial body of prior work in several intersecting areas:\n\n1. **Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Capability:** Recent progress has demonstrated the potential of LLMs like GPT-4 and systems such as MedPALM to perform impressively across general medical benchmarks and various tasks such as web search, coding, and intelligent content creation.\n\n2. **Healthcare AI Applications:** Existing AI applications in healthcare have focused on tasks like clinical note processing, EHR summarization, and medical question-answering. However, these systems show significant error rates in specialized use-cases and struggle with medical reasoning required for nuanced healthcare scenarios.\n\n3. **Conversational Healthcare Systems:** There is limited work on AI systems designed for broader, non-diagnostic conversations between caregivers and patients. AMIE, for example, focuses on diagnostic dialogues, leaving a gap in the broader conversational needs, such as adherence to prescriptions and wellness check-ins, which are non-diagnostic but still require medical accuracy and empathy.\n\n4. **Healthcare Workforce Challenges:** The US healthcare industry faces a critical staffing shortage, with projections indicating a massive gap in supply and demand for healthcare workers. This situation underscores the need to develop technologies like AI-based healthcare agents that can alleviate the burden on human workers and improve efficiency.\n\nBy addressing these gaps and building on existing research, the paper aims to contribute a novel multi-agent LLM constellation architecture specifically designed for the healthcare context, with a strong emphasis on safety, real-time interaction, and patient-centered care.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology\n\n**Proposed Method: Polaris Architecture**\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **Primary and Specialist LLMs**: The primary innovation in Polaris is the use of a constellation architecture comprising a primary language model and multiple specialist language models (LLMs). Each model in this constellation is tailored to handle specific tasks or domains within healthcare, ensuring that interactions are more precise and domain-specific.\n  \n2. **Supporting System**: To facilitate seamless interactions and maintain conversation flow, Polaris includes an advanced supporting system. This system is responsible for:\n   - **Orchestrating Control Flow**: Managing and directing the sequence of interactions between the primary LLM and the specialist LLMs, ensuring smooth and coherent conversation progression.\n   - **Inter-Model Message Passing**: Allowing communication between the various LLMs, so they can share information and context as needed to provide accurate and comprehensive responses.\n   - **Maintaining Conversation State**: Keeping track of the ongoing conversation's context and state, ensuring that the system can refer back to previous interactions for consistency and continuity.\n\n**Innovations:**\n- **Domain-Specific Interactions**: By dividing the tasks among specialist LLMs, Polaris can handle domain-specific inquiries and provide responses that are more accurate and relevant compared to a single general-purpose LLM.\n- **Emphasis on Safety and Verification**: Given the critical nature of healthcare, Polaris places a strong emphasis on safety and the ability to verify information. This architecture supports the implementation of checks and balances to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the responses provided by the system.\n\nIn conclusion, Polaris leverages a novel constellation architecture of primary and specialist LLMs, supported by an orchestrated system to improve the quality and safety of interactions in healthcare, emphasizing domain-specific expertise and verification mechanisms. The detailed architecture and constituent models are further elaborated in the subsequent sections of the paper.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\n#### Datasets\nThe experiments focus on two primary datasets:\n1. **Subjective User Experience Survey Data**: Responses are collected from users acting as patients after interacting with Polaris and human nurses.\n2. **Clinical Capability Validation Test Cases**: A series of test cases that represent conversational scenarios in a healthcare setting to assess specific medical conversational capabilities.\n\n#### Baselines\nThe performance of Polaris is compared against:\n1. **GPT-4**: A larger, general-purpose Language Model (using the \"gpt-4-0613\" version).\n2. **LLaMA-2 70B Chat**: Another medium-sized Language Model in the same class as Polaris.\n3. **Human Nurses**: U.S. licensed nurses provide the baseline for human performance in healthcare conversations.\n\n#### Evaluation Metrics\nThe performance of the models is assessed based on:\n1. **Overall Subjective User Experience**: Survey responses focused on user satisfaction and perceived conversational quality.\n2. **Clinical Capability Validation**: Focused assessment of tasks or functions in healthcare conversations such as:\n   - Commenting on user-provided lab values (isolated task capability).\n   - Conducting calculations.\n   - Performing numerical comparisons.\n   - Executing specific detailed subroutines like medication reconciliation.\n   \n### Main Experimental Results\nThe results of the main experiment indicate the following:\n1. **Subjective User Experience**: Survey comparisons show that users rated their experience with Polaris similarly to their interactions with human nurses, establishing that Polaris has core conversational competence equivalent to human nurses.\n2. **Clinical Capability**: Polaris demonstrated effectiveness in handling specific medical conversational capabilities. The strategy of compartmentalizing complex tasks significantly improved its performance. In scenarios such as lab value commentary and medication reconciliation, Polaris outperformed GPT-4, showing that a specialized architecture better handles these focused tasks compared to a general-purpose model solely responsible for all aspects of the conversation.\n\nThis indicates that Polaris provides a robust and clinically relevant conversational capability in the healthcare domain, meeting or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art large language models and approaching the competence of trained human nurses in subjective user experience."
