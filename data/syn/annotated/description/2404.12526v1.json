    "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) have become the hallmark of modern AI, however, these models are trained on massive data, leading to financially expensive training. Updating FMs as new data becomes available is important, however, can lead to \u2018catastrophic forgetting\u2019, where models underperform on tasks related to data sub-populations observed too long ago. \u2020\u2020*Work done during internship at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.\nThis continual learning (CL) phenomenon has been extensively studied, but primarily in a setting where only a small amount of past data can be stored. We advocate for the paradigm where memory is abundant, allowing us to keep all previous data, but computational resources are limited. In this setting, traditional replay-based CL approaches are outperformed by a simple baseline which replays past data selected uniformly at random [37], indicating that this setting necessitates a new approach. We address this by introducing a framework of adaptive memory replay for continual learning, where sampling of past data is phrased as a multi-armed bandit problem. We utilize Bolzmann sampling to derive a method which dynamically selects past data for training conditioned on the current task, assuming full data access and emphasizing training efficiency.\nThrough extensive evaluations on both vision and language pre-training tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which maintains high performance while reducing forgetting by up to  at no training efficiency cost.",

            "text": "The concept of the Foundation Models (FMs) [2  ###reference_b2###] has recently gained popularity\nand became ubiquitous in many downstream applications, including language [51  ###reference_b51###, 4  ###reference_b4###, 33  ###reference_b33###], vision [38  ###reference_b38###, 41  ###reference_b41###, 52  ###reference_b52###], and other application domains - advocating towards the \u2018train-once-and-use-everywhere\u2019 paradigm shift in AI/ML. One of the most attractive features of FMs is their ability for Zero-Shot [4  ###reference_b4###] prompting, few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) [4  ###reference_b4###, 55  ###reference_b55###], and great transferability to any task [33  ###reference_b33###, 52  ###reference_b52###]. This is due to their massive scale pre-training, often on billions [43  ###reference_b43###] or trillions [33  ###reference_b33###, 51  ###reference_b51###] of data points. However, such power comes with high training costs. The pre-training data size is so large that normally each sample is observed only a few times or, as in language training, once (single epoch). Moreover, a common requirement for FMs is to rather frequently undergo \u2018Extended Pre-Training\u2019 (EPT)\n- a process of updating the model with new (massive) additional data intended to improve the model\u2019s temporal currency. During EPT the original pre-training data cannot be naively replayed as, given the massive size of both pre-training and EPT data, it would effectively double the EPT cost (naturally assuming a single epoch and 50% replay mix for EPT as is customary in such cases). This would be prohibitive both in terms of the high cost (millions of dollars) as well as non-negligible negative environmental impact (extra heat emission).\nHowever, neglecting past data during EPT is prone to the issue of catastrophic forgetting [21  ###reference_b21###], where models updated with new data tend to underperform on previously seen data. This leads to an important question: how can we adapt large-scale FM models to an ever-evolving world without compromising on performance or efficiency?\n###figure_1### The realm of continual learning offers some insights, but also limitations. While current benchmarks effectively highlight the challenge of catastrophic forgetting by training on non-overlapping data tasks sequentially, they are less applicable to (massive scale) EPT, as they either restrict themselves to limited memory storage (while in practical EPT all data, past and current, is usually available) and do not take into account the training cost of replay. For practical EPT, we argue the cost impact needs to be minimal in the sense that the \u2018continual\u2019 EPT needs to have similar cost as \u2018naive\u2019 EPT (disregarding old data and catastrophic forgetting issue). This is intuitive, as even the tiny overhead fraction due to replay will be applied as a factor to the training cost (measured in millions of dollars for the large-scale models [33  ###reference_b33###]).\nThis new setting of restricted computation and unlimited storage of past data has recently been explored for continual learning of image classification tasks [37  ###reference_b37###]. The results of that work suggest that a simple baseline which randomly selects from all past data outperforms other replay-based CL methods. This creates a demand for a new approach which can better utilize all of the past data.\nTaking inspiration from prior works [3  ###reference_b3###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 17  ###reference_b17###] that have tried to select memory data intelligently by selecting the most representative samples of each memory replay dataset, we push the boundaries by considering not which past samples are the most representative (which is typically pre-decided before training future tasks), but rather which samples most effectively prevent forgetting conditioned on the current task data (which is decided during the training of future tasks). This notion is based on the intuitive concept that the model retains full access to previously seen data and that the \u2018optimal\u2019 replay data may be contingent upon the new data a model encounters during EPT.\nWe specifically propose an approach that dynamically adjusts the proportion of replay samples from each past task based on its propensity to be forgotten given the new task data. In such an adaptive memory replay for continual learning (visualized in Figure 1  ###reference_###), our algorithm efficiently decides on the optimal allocation of memory replay samples among past tasks to minimize overall forgetting, under the vital consideration of how to do this without the requirement for drastic computation. We do this through a combination of bandit estimation and Boltzmann sampling from clusters of old datasets store in memory. We evaluate our replay strategy for both vision and language large-scale pre-training tasks.\nIn particular, we propose and evaluate a zero-cost protocol that includes intelligent selection of both data to replay and reduction in the new EPT data to compensate for the (relatively small) extra cost of the selection algorithm itself.\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\nWe present an adaptive memory replay for continual learning, a novel scheme inspired by a bandit estimation formulation that assumes full memory access and dynamically adjusts replay samples based on the new data, ensuring reduced forgetting.\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both vision and language large-scale pre-training tasks."

            "text": "In the past decade, there has been significant progress in continual learning to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Regularization-based methods [24  ###reference_b24###, 44  ###reference_b44###, 27  ###reference_b27###] modify the model parameters with additional regularization constraints to prevent catastrophic forgetting. They store no data but explore extra regularization terms in the loss function to consolidate previous knowledge. Rehearsal approaches [40  ###reference_b40###, 40  ###reference_b40###, 6  ###reference_b6###] memorize or generate a small fraction of data points for previous tasks and utilizes them to retain the task knowledge. Importantly, what data to retain is decided during the task itself, and subsequently used throughout future tasks. Expansion approaches expand a model\u2019s architecture as new tasks are encountered; these are highly effective for applications where a model growing with tasks is practical  [14  ###reference_b14###, 25  ###reference_b25###, 28  ###reference_b28###, 30  ###reference_b30###, 42  ###reference_b42###]. Our work does not consider these methods because the model parameters grow with the number of tasks, but acknowledge that the contributions could be incorporated into these approaches.\nRecently, prompt-tuning methods such as [53  ###reference_b53###, 54  ###reference_b54###, 48  ###reference_b48###] outperformed rehearsal-based methods without using a replay buffer by learning a small number of insertable model instructions or prompts. Another line of research is the parameter isolation-based approaches [29  ###reference_b29###, 58  ###reference_b58###, 20  ###reference_b20###] which focus on freezing the task-specific parameters and growing new branches for new tasks. [20  ###reference_b20###] propose adapters which add a small number of parameters to the model for training on downstream tasks. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [22  ###reference_b22###] extends on the above by using low-rank matrix counterparts of the original weights during fine-tuning, and keeps the actual weights frozen to further reduce inference costs.\nContinual Learning in Transformers:\nThe recent Vision Transformer (ViT) [12  ###reference_b12###] has made a pure Transformer architecture scalable for large scale image classification and several works [26  ###reference_b26###, 13  ###reference_b13###, 15  ###reference_b15###] have successfully applied the Transformers architecture for continual learning. In [26  ###reference_b26###], for each new task, the model is copied and fixed to be used as the teacher model in the distillation phase. In [13  ###reference_b13###], a unified model is learned by building upon a new architecture which dynamically expands the tokens processed by the last layer to mitigate forgetting. For each task, they learn a new task specific token per head using task-attention based decoder blocks. Recently, [15  ###reference_b15###] proposes a method based on pre-trained Transformers while maintaining strict control of the memory usage and reaching state-of-the-art predictive performance. However the above methods either train a new transformer or need to fine-tune large pre-trained transformer models which requires significant compute in contrast to our objective of achieving optimal performance with limited compute.\nCoreset Replay for Continual Learning:\nRehearsal-based methods use a memory buffer to store selective samples of the previous tasks. These samples are then replayed with new task data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. A notable rehearsal-based method, Experience Replay (ER) from memory [40  ###reference_b40###] interleaves the previous task samples with the current task data for optimizing the network parameters. E2E [10  ###reference_b10###] deploys a herding algorithm to bolster coreset representativeness of the past task training data. ERT [7  ###reference_b7###] further extends ER by a balanced sampling strategy and bias control. Selective replay [17  ###reference_b17###] proposes task-based rehearsal strategies for sample selection based on class-margin boundary, minimum confidence etc. DER++ [6  ###reference_b6###] mixes rehearsal with a distillation loss for preventing catastrophic forgetting. HAL [11  ###reference_b11###] integrates ER with an additional objective of keeping the predictions on anchor points of past tasks intact. MIR [39  ###reference_b39###], GDumb [36  ###reference_b36###] and ASER [46  ###reference_b46###] store samples based on parameter updates, order of sample arrival and memory-based class boundaries respectively. Finally, ACE [3  ###reference_b3###] explores various alternative population strategies to select coreset replay data. While the above methods consider the representativeness of data stored in the memory, they fail to take into"

Performing one of the actions returns a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown distribution. The problem is selecting a number of actions in a way which minimizes the expected regret, defined as the expected difference between the rewards obtained by always choosing the optimal action and the rewards obtained by following our strategy. At each step, a bandit strategy approximates the parameters of the reward distribution of each of the  actions. Thereafter, the strategy needs to select an action to perform. One such strategy is Boltzmann Exploration [23  ###reference_b23###] which computes the mean of the observed rewards for each action, and then uses all means to define a categorical distribution, from which the choice of action is drawn. Finally, if the action\u2019s distributions change between steps, the bandit problem is referred to as non-stationary [59  ###reference_b59###]."

First, data storage is cheap, therefore it is possible to store and sample from any dataset we have seen before. Second, computation is expensive, meaning that we cannot re-train on all of the past data in memory. Following this insight, we modify the CL setting so that all of the past data can be stored, but a CL algorithm\u2019s computational demands to access and use the past data need to be constant and compensated during training to lead to zero extra cost (compared to naive training only on new data).\nBeing able to access all of the past data naturally leads to a rehearsal-based approach where one can only replay a limited subset , due to computational constraints. In contrast to the typical memory replay solutions,  is not fixed while training on a new task, but is instead allowed to adapt to the new data and the changing model while maintaining training efficiency. Therefore, we refer to it as an adaptive memory buffer.\nWe begin developing our approach by modifying the objective function to better reflect our goal. First, as detailed in the Appendix, we express the main objective (Eq. 1  ###reference_###) in terms of its forgetting  on past data, compared to the performance of the optimal parameters for the previous task:\nwhere  is a constant.\nThis change reflects the fact that we fine-tune the previously optimal model on the new task and that our focus is on minimizing forgetting, rather than improving our performance on past data. Next, we define the optimal memory buffer  as the subset of past data for which our model has the maximum forgetting. We then following replay-based methods (Eq. 2  ###reference_###) and similarly optimize:\nMinimizing this objective leads to our rehearsal-based CL algorithm with adaptive memory  which replays the past data points  that have currently been forgotten the most. Importantly, to minimize the overhead which replaying imposes on the training process, we keep the number of computed gradients constant by discarding a portion of the data on the new task. To do this, we remove  randomly selected data points for each batch of inputs from the new task, thus keeping the total number of processed inputs the same.\nIn order to compute Eq. 3  ###reference_###, we need to be able to select  \u2014 the subset of all past data with the highest forgetting. This subset changes as we update the parameters , and it is computationally infeasible to evaluate the forgetting of each of the past data points. Instead, we seek to divide all past data into clusters  of items expected to have similar forgetting values.\nThis allows us to infer the forgetting values of the data points in a cluster, based on a small number of evaluations, and use this to select data points for our adaptive memory buffer which exhibits a high amount of forgetting. Currently, we place all of the data from the same previous task into the same cluster, i.e. , and assume that it would exhibit similar forgetting values. We leave more elaborate clustering techniques for future work."

For the parameters  at training iteration , we would like to select a subset  which exhibits close to the worst forgetting, minimizing the following quantity:\nWe frame this as a non-stationary K-armed bandit (KAB) problem [47  ###reference_b47###], where pulling an arm and receiving a reward corresponds to sampling a data point from a cluster and evaluating its forgetting. Then, at each training iteration, we have to choose which of the K arms to pull in order to select  data points with maximum forgetting. As we select different  over all training steps, we would like to reduce the expected regret: , which is the expected difference in forgetting values between  and  over all training steps. In this work, we implement the Boltzmann Exploration [23  ###reference_b23###] approach which, at training step , approximates the mean reward of each arm, denoted by , and then uses all arms\u2019 means as parameters for a categorical distribution over the choice of arms to pull.

We utilize two distinct pre-trained models as our backbones for these experiments: a Vision Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [18  ###reference_b18###] pre-trained on ImageNet-1K for vision-related tasks, and LLaMA [50  ###reference_b50###] with 7 billion parameters for language experiments. The evaluation metrics for our experiments are twofold: test data Final Loss and test data loss Forgetting. The Loss metrics are standard for FM training (especially in Language Modeling) as they are known to correlate with downstream use due to the massive pre-training volumes and de-facto seeing most of the samples only once. These metrics are normalized between 0% and 100%, where 0% represents an offline upper bound with all data trained independently and identically distributed (iid), and 100% corresponds to the performance of the pre-trained model without any fine-tuning.\nBecause our primary contribution lies in our novel perspective of full-memory replay, we compare our approach with full memory-access iid data replay as opposed to typical continual learning methods. We hypothesize that coreset selection replay methods are effectively upper-bounded by full iid replay, given their goal of identifying the most representative data for replay (rather than our perspective of identifying the most forgotten data for replay as a function of the current data). Consequently, we do not compare our method against sampled data replay in our main results tables as we store all data in memory.\nFurthermore, our experiments are designed to demonstrate the advantages of our adaptive memory replay approach over traditional iid replay, especially in terms of computational efficiency and reduced forgetting. We consider gains of our approach to be orthogonal to the realms of non-replay regularization-based continual learning methods, and thus these comparisons are not the main focus of our results. Besides, from the perspective of computational efficiency, recent work has found such approaches to be impractical for computationally bounded continual learning [16  ###reference_b16###]. However, we do discuss the interaction of our approach with different continual learning strategies like regularization methods and knowledge distillation in our Appendix.\nThe hyperparameters for our experiments were meticulously chosen based on a series of small task experiments. We update our model on  new data examples per task. In the interest of computational resources for the larger Llama model, we approximate the training of all the model parameters with LoRA finetuning [22  ###reference_b22###] in the language modeling experiments. In our experience, conclusions attained for LoRA finetuning reflect the same in full model training. We use a learning rate of  for full model fine-tuning and  for LoRA-based fine-tuning. For our proposed adaptive memory replay bandit scheme, we found that a temperature of  and forgetting mean update ratio of  performed best. We compose our replay batches for both iid replay and our adaptive memory replay with a 1:1 ratio of replay data to new task training data. We conducted evaluations on a hold-out test dataset comprising 500 samples per dataset. Additional training details can be found in our Appendix."

Our goal was to demonstrate the robustness of our findings with a variety of unique and practical dataset sequences. The first dataset is the DomainNet [34  ###reference_b34###] dataset (Table 1  ###reference_###), containing 6 different domains of common objects. The next is the Medical MNIST dataset [57  ###reference_b57###] (Table 2  ###reference_###), from which we sampled 5 standardized biomedical image datasets containing the highest number of samples.

Our approach consistently outperforms full memory iid replay (which serves as an upper bound for other replay-based continual learning methods that sample from a limited coreset), achieving lower final loss and forgetting rates. The slight increase in normalized training time is negligible compared to the performance gains, and furthermore, we show a 0-cost result where we reduce the number of training steps of our approach to align with the training time of naive fine-tuning, and show that even this result outperforms iid replay in all three benchmarks.\nWe note that our strongest performance gains come from the DomainNet results. The gains for the medical data sequence and synthetic data pre-training are much more modest, yet remain pronounced. The synthetic data sequence is interesting in that forward transfer (i.e., negative forgetting) appears in all results - however, our method still has more forward transfer compared to iid replay. In practical terms, our results imply that vision systems equipped with our continual learning strategy would exhibit improved robustness over time, adapting to new data without significant loss of prior knowledge or computational costs. We re-iterate that there is much more room for improvement from our full-memory continual learning perspective - advanced strategies can close the gap between our method and the upper bound with fixed time costs by exploring interesting questions such as how to better cluster the data and which new data is more or less favorable to discard."

Our findings, rooted in extensive evaluations across both vision and language tasks, validate the advantages of our adaptive memory replay for continual learning.

Ultimately, we hope to inspire methodologies that are both computationally efficient and effective in real-world continual learning scenarios, where data access and computational resources are bound by practical constraints. This research trajectory serves as a stepping stone towards the development of continually learning systems that efficiently and intelligently utilize all available data, enhancing their learning and adaptability across a series of tasks throughout their life-cycle.\nFuture work should focus on refining the adaptive memory replay mechanism, particularly exploring more sophisticated bandit-based selection strategies to further enhance the balance between retaining old knowledge and accommodating new information. The decision of which data to discard during the replay phase also warrants deeper investigation to avoid potential loss of critical information (and furthermore potential unrealized gains in discarding repetitive or similar samples). There is also a great need to develop advancing clustering techniques to capture the subtleties of data evolution which can lead to more representative memory buffers. In addition, bringing greater realism into continual learning models by incorporating real-world constraints and scenarios will be crucial, such as blurred task boundaries and online clustering."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation ###\n\nThe paper is motivated by the growing prominence and utility of Foundation Models (FMs), which are capable of Zero-Shot prompting, few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), and task transferability due to their extensive pre-training on massive datasets. Despite their strengths, these models face challenges of high training costs, potential catastrophic forgetting during Extended Pre-Training (EPT), and the environmental impacts associated with additional pre-training. The authors aim to address these challenges by developing a method to integrate and optimize continual learning during EPT without compromising efficiency or performance.\n\n### Research Problem ###\n\nThe primary research problem tackled by the paper is how to adapt large-scale Foundation Models (FMs) in a continually evolving environment without incurring prohibitive costs or suffering from performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. The goal is to establish an efficient method for memory replay during EPT, leveraging all past data while maintaining minimal additional computational costs.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work ###\n\n1. **Foundation Models (FMs):**\n   - These models have revolutionized AI/ML applications across different domains by adopting the \"train-once-and-use-everywhere\" paradigm, supported by substantial pre-training on massive datasets ([2  ###reference_b2###], [33  ###reference_b33###], [43  ###reference_b43###], [51  ###reference_b51###]).\n   - FMs exhibit capabilities like Zero-Shot prompting and ICL, which owe to their extensive training ([4  ###reference_b4###], [52  ###reference_b52###], [55  ###reference_b55###]).\n\n2. **Challenges with EPT:**\n   - EPT is a process that updates models with new data to keep them temporally current but is fraught with issues like catastrophic forgetting of earlier data ([21  ###reference_b21###]) and high costs if not managed efficiently.\n\n3. **Continual Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting:**\n   - Classical benchmarks in continual learning reveal shortcomings in addressing catastrophic forgetting but usually operate under limited memory storage constraints, which are not applicable at the scale of EPT ([21  ###reference_b21###], [37  ###reference_b37###]).\n\n4. **Adaptive Memory Selection:**\n   - Prior works ([3  ###reference_b3###], [10  ###reference_b10###], [17  ###reference_b17###]) have attempted to address forgetting by intelligently selecting representative samples for memory replay. However, they typically pre-select samples before the training of future tasks rather than dynamically adjusting during training.\n\nThe approach proposed in this paper builds upon these foundations by introducing an algorithm that dynamically selects and adjusts replay samples from past data during EPT, leveraging bandit estimation and Boltzmann sampling to keep computing costs inline while reducing forgetting and improving model performance.",
        "methodology": "In this section, we first modify the typical CL setting by challenging the restrictive assumption that past data cannot be accessed. Second, we modify the objective which we minimize, in order to better reflect the new CL setting. Third, we link the resulting problem to that of multi-armed bandit allocation and detail our approach.\n\n**Key Components and Innovations:**\n\n1. **Modified Continual Learning (CL) Setting:**\n   The traditional CL setting strictly prohibits access to past data. We relax this constraint by allowing access to previously seen data, which modifies the CL setting to be more realistic and practical for real-world applications. This alteration addresses limitations in the conventional approach and enables more effective continual learning by leveraging past experiences.\n\n2. **New Objective Function:**\n   We redefine the objective function to better align with the modified CL setting. The new objective accounts for the availability of past data and optimizes the learning algorithm to make more informed decisions based on previously encountered experiences. This shift in the objective function enhances the model's ability to learn continually without succumbing to the drawbacks of stringent data restrictions.\n\n3. **Connection to Multi-Armed Bandit Allocation:**\n   The newly formulated problem is connected to the well-known multi-armed bandit allocation problem. Drawing parallels with this problem allows us to employ established strategies and theoretical foundations from the multi-armed bandit domain to solve our CL task. The multi-armed bandit framework provides a robust mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation, which is crucial for effective continual learning.\n\n4. **Detailed Approach:**\n   Our approach leverages techniques from the multi-armed bandit literature to guide the memory replay process. By intelligently selecting which past data to replay based on a bandit algorithm, we ensure that the learning model continually revisits important past experiences while still absorbing new information. This method allows for an adaptive and efficient memory replay system that enhances the overall learning process.\n\nThis methodology section outlines the innovative steps taken to improve the continual learning process by relaxing data access constraints, redefining the learning objective, and employing a bandit-based approach for adaptive memory replay.",
