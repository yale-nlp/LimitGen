    "title": "Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density",
    "abstract": "Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly.\nIn this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT.\nSpecifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop.\nTo address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation\nin a self-supervised manner.\nOur experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks.\nSpecifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters.\nCompared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters.

            "text": "Sign languages are the primary form of communication for millions of deaf individuals. Sign language translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language into fluent spoken language sentences, which is a challenging task as it needs to extract information from continuous video and translate it into discrete text tokens.\nMost prior studies promoted the SLT by utilizing intermediate representations, namely gloss annotations, either directly or indirectly Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###); Yin and Read,  (2020  ###reference_b39###); Zhou et al., 2021a  ###reference_b43###; Chen et al.,  (2022  ###reference_b6###); Zhang et al., 2023a  ###reference_b40###; Ye et al., 2023b  ###reference_b37###.\nGloss annotations are beneficial as they provide a simplified representation and sequential ordering of each gesture within continuous sign videos, which aids in representation learning for visual encoders.\nHowever, the creation of sign language translation datasets with gloss annotations is both resource-intensive and time-consuming.\nRecently, there has been a shift towards gloss-free sign language translation methods, which do not rely on gloss annotations to train SLT models. These methods usually rely on general datasets Yin et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b38###), general pretraning strategy  Zhou et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b42###), or general large-scale foundation models Wong et al.,  (2024  ###reference_b33###) to promote gloss-free SLT. However, there is a substantial gap between the sign language domain and the general domain Ye et al., 2023a  ###reference_b36###; Kan et al.,  (2022  ###reference_b19###).\nModels trained with general strategies or datasets often fail to capture the subtle differences in semantically distinct gestures, which are crucial for accurately understanding a specific sign language.\nTherefore, the performance of gloss-free methods still significantly lags behind that of gloss-based approaches.\nIn this paper, we identify a representation density problem in sign language translation: the visual representations of sign gestures with distinct semantics are likely to be close in representation space.\nThis problem is attributed to the nature of sign language, a form of visual language that utilizes intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements to convey the signer\u2018s message Pizzuto,  (2003  ###reference_b27###); Vinson et al.,  (2010  ###reference_b32###).\nFor example, in Figure 1  ###reference_###, the signer performs sign gestures for opposite meanings, \u201cRECIPROCATE\u201d and \u201cREVENGE\u201d, with similar visual information (i.e., only subtle differences in facial movements). The visual encoder in SLT models will encode similar visual information to visual representations in adjacent representation space, even though they have distinct semantics.\nWithout explicit gloss annotations, SLT models struggle to learn semantic boundaries in continuous sign videos and capture distinguishing visual representations for different sign gestures. As a result, the representation density problem poses a significant challenge for the SLT models in distinguishing between various sign gestures, leading to sharp performance drops. (Section  2.2  ###reference_###).\n###figure_1### Further, we investigate various popular sign feature extraction methods, including gloss-based Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###); Min et al.,  (2021  ###reference_b25###) and gloss-free Yin et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b38###); Zhou et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b42###), to systematically study the representation density problem. As shown in Figure 2  ###reference_###, our investigation reveals that the representation density problem is prevalent across sign feature extraction methods.\nSpecifically, due to the lack of gloss annotations, the representation density problem appears to be more serious in gloss-free methods. Then, we conduct extensive SLT experiments and observe that SLT models using gloss-free sign features as input consistently suffer a drop in performance in both sign language recognition and translation tasks compared to those using gloss-based sign features (Section  2.3  ###reference_###).\nTherefore, we demonstrate that the representation density problem can be a bottleneck in restricting the improvement of gloss-free sign language translation.\nMore importantly, we propose a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy named SignCL to address the representation density problem. Specifically, SignCL draws the visual representations of sign gestures with identical semantics closer together and pushes those with different semantics farther apart. Experimental results show that SignCL can learn more distinctive feature representations and lead to significant improvements in terms of BLEU score on various well-known SLT frameworks (Section  4  ###reference_###).\nTo summarize, the main contributions of this work are as follows:\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work identifies the representation density problem in sign language translation for the first time. This problem is consistent across various sign feature extraction methods for SLT, including gloss-based and gloss-free methods.\nExperimental results empirically reveal that an increase in representation density leads to a significant performance drop in the accuracy of sign language recognition and translation. We find that the representation density problem poses a significant challenge for the gloss-free SLT.\nWe propose a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, to address the representation density problem.\nOur experiments demonstrate that SignCL can significantly enhance various well-known SLT frameworks.\nSpecifically, SignCL yields a 39.01% BLEU score improvement for the Sign Language Transformer Camgoz et al., 2020a  ###reference_b4### and a 45.58% increase for GFSLT-VLP Zhou et al., 2021a  ###reference_b43### on the CSL-Daily dataset."

            "text": "This section investigates the representation density problem within existing sign feature extraction techniques and examines whether representation density influences sign language recognition and translation performance.\nExisting sign feature extraction methods can be divided into two categories: 1) gloss-based (e.g., Sign Recognition Pretrained Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###) and Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation Min et al.,  (2021  ###reference_b25###)) and 2) gloss-free (e.g., I3D Pretraining Yin et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b38###) and Visual-Language Pretraining Zhou et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b42###)).\nThese methods were chosen for their representativeness in SLT and their well-documented open-source sign features.\nSign Recognition Pretrained (SRP) Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###): This approach leverages the sign language recognition datasets to train sign language recognition models and uses it as the feature extractor for the SLT task.\nNotably, the features released by Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###) have been widely adopted as input features in a range of works Camgoz et al., 2020b  ###reference_b5###; Zhou et al., 2021a  ###reference_b43###; Jin and Zhao,  (2021  ###reference_b17###); Yao et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b35###); Ye et al., 2023b  ###reference_b37###.\nSelf-Mutual Knowledge Distillation (SMKD) Hao et al.,  (2021  ###reference_b13###): This approach enhances SRP by enforcing the visual and contextual modules to focus on short-term and long-term information Hao et al.,  (2021  ###reference_b13###). SMKD feature extraction has been shown to substantially enhance SLT translation performance compared to SRP Zhang et al., 2023b  ###reference_b41###; Ye et al., 2023b  ###reference_b37###.\nI3D Pretraining (I3D) Yin et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b38###): This method employs I3D models as the backbone to pre-train the feature extractor, initially trained on the Kinetics dataset Kay et al.,  (2017  ###reference_b20###) and subsequently fine-tuned on extensive web SLR datasets, such as WSLR Li et al., 2020a  ###reference_b22###.\nVisual-Language Pretraining (VLP) Zhou et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b42###): This method entirely forgoes gloss annotations and leverages a general visual-language pretraining strategy to align sign video representation with text. Embodied by GFSLT-VLP Zhou et al.,  (2023  ###reference_b42###), this approach offers a more general solution that utilizes a broader range of sign language resources without the constraints of gloss annotations.\nDrawing inspiration from Fisher\u2019s Discriminant Ratio (FDR) Kalinkov et al.,  (2019  ###reference_b18###); Harish and Manju,  (2018  ###reference_b14###), a typical measure used to evaluate the discriminative power of features in the classification, we combine the average Inter-Gloss Distance and Intra-Gloss Distance into Sign Density Ratio (SDR, see Eqn. 1  ###reference_###), which reflects the degree of representation density for each gloss . This is given by the formula:\nHere,  represents the Inter-Gloss Distance between two glosses  and , and avg.  reflects the average distance of  to all other glosses. The Intra-Gloss Distance  evaluates the average distance within a single gloss\n. These distances are given by the following formulas:\nWhere,  and  denote the number of instances in glosses  and  respectively, and  represents the distance measure between the embeddings of instances  and , i.e., euclidean distance.\nThe average Sign Density Ratio (SDR) of all glosses, denoted as , is calculated to evaluate the overall representation density of the dataset comprehensively.\nTo calculate the Sign Density Ratio (SDR), we need to determine the mapping relationship between input frames and gloss categories. Following previous works K\u00fcrzinger et al.,  (2020  ###reference_b21###); Ye et al., 2023b  ###reference_b37###, we employ the CTC classifier as a sign-gloss forced aligner to establish the mapping between each gloss and its corresponding sign frames. The aligner provides the start position  and end position  within the video frame sequence for each corresponding gloss . To optimize alignment performance on the test set, we merge the training and test datasets for comprehensive training and engage two volunteers to select the best frame  from the range [:] to align with each gloss . Extensive details on the training procedure and the aligner\u2019s performance metrics are documented in Appendix 5  ###reference_###.\nWe primarily use the PHOENIX-2014T benchmark Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###) to investigate the representation density problem in existing sign feature extraction techniques.\nThis benchmark was selected due to its rich collection of open-source sign features contributed by various research efforts.\nWe obtained the sign features by either downloading the officially released versions or reproducing the feature extraction process.\nThen, we employed t-SNE Van der Maaten and Hinton,  (2008  ###reference_b31###) to visualize the feature distribution of these semantically distinct sign gestures to investigate representation density.\n###figure_2### ###figure_3### ###figure_4### ###figure_5### ###figure_6### Through empirical analysis of various visualized open-source sign features, we have identified a widespread representation density problem across different sign feature extraction methods. As depicted in Figure 2  ###reference_###, all evaluated methods display a Sign Density Ratio exceeding 50%, with inevitable overlap of feature representation. Notably, gloss-free methods that do not utilize gloss annotations as additional supervision (e.g., I3D and VLP) exhibit even more severe representation density compared to gloss-based methods. This is evident as sign gestures representing different semantics, indicated by different colors, significantly overlap, resulting in translation ambiguity during inference. Specifically, the Sign Density Ratio (SDR) of VLP is 92.59%, which is significantly higher than the SDR of SMKD at 66.23%.\n###figure_7### ###figure_8### This part employs the widely utilized Sign Language Transformer Camgoz et al., 2020b  ###reference_b5### (NSLT) as the foundational model for our evaluations.\nThe choice is because\nits capability to perform both SLT and SLR tasks, as well as take SLR and SLT at the same time (joint-SLT). Additionally, the NSLT framework is well-established within sign language research and benefits from comprehensive documentation and support in open-source sign feature sets and baseline results.\nThe NSLT relies on sign features derived using a pretrained sign feature extractor. This section studies all types of sign features introduced in Section 2.2  ###reference_### to investigate the representation density problem.\nWe use the Sign Density Ratio (SDR, see Eqn.  1  ###reference_###) to measure the representation density within each type of input feature. We measure SLR and SLT performance by the recognition accuracy and the BLEU-4 Papineni et al.,  (2002  ###reference_b26###) score (B@4), respectively.\n(1) Sign Language Recognition: To evaluate the ability of the extracted sign features to distinguish between different semantic gestures, we use the NSLT Camgoz et al., 2020a  ###reference_b4### to perform sign language recognition (SLR) tasks with various types of sign features Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###) as model input. Due to the limited number of samples for each gesture in the dev set, we rank the sign glosses based on their density using SDR under SMKD features (see Eqn.  1  ###reference_###). These glosses are then divided into nine groups (bins), each containing approximately 60 glosses. The average SDR and recognition accuracy for each bin represents the overall density and mean accuracy of the glosses within that bin, respectively.\n(2) Sign Language Translation: This evaluation aims to demonstrate the impact of representation density on translation tasks. We evaluate various sign features as inputs to the Sign Language Transformer, including SRP, SMKD, I3D, VLP, and VLP+SignCL. These inputs are tested across different translation frameworks, such as NSLT Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###), Joint-SLT Camgoz et al., 2020a  ###reference_b4###, and NSLT+SignCL. NSLT means use NSLT to perform SLT without CTC loss (gloss-free) and the NSLT+SignCL configuration integrates the proposed contrastive learning strategy into the encoder of NSLT Camgoz et al.,  (2018  ###reference_b3###) models, as detailed in Section 3  ###reference_###.\nAs depicted in Figure 3  ###reference_###, the following observations were made regarding the impact of representation density on both recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT):\nPerformance suffers from representation density. We consistently observed a negative relationship between representation density and performance across all feature types and tasks. Higher representation density leads to worse accuracy in SLR and lower BLEU scores in SLT. Specifically, an increase in the representation density ratio by 26% can result in a 36% performance drop in NSLT.\nGloss-free methods suffer from worse representation density.\nGloss-free based feature extractions, which do not use any gloss annotations for assistance (e.g., VLP), typically exhibit higher representation density scores than gloss-based approach (e.g., SDR(VLP)=92.59% > SDR(SMKD)=66.23%).\nUsing gloss-free features results in worse recognition and translation performance compared to gloss-based feature extractions (e.g., VLP vs. SMKD).\nContrastive learning boosts performance by reducing representation density. When contrastive learning is applied to augment gloss-free based feature representation learning, i.e., VLP+SignCL for feature extraction or NSLT+SignCL for downstream finetuning, there is a consistent reduction in feature representation density accompanied by a significant improvement in both of the SLR accuracy and the SLT performance (see detail can be found in Section 3  ###reference_###)."

        "research_background": "**Paper Motivation:**\nThe primary motivation of this paper is to improve the performance of gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) methods. Gloss annotations are often used to provide a simplified and structured representation of sign languages, aiding in the training of SLT models. However, creating these gloss annotations is resource-intensive and time-consuming, leading to a growing interest in gloss-free SLT methods. The paper identifies a unique challenge in existing gloss-free SLT approaches, named the \"representation density problem,\" where visually similar but semantically distinct gestures are encoded close to one another in the representation space. This issue significantly hampers the effectiveness of gloss-free SLT models.\n\n**Research Problem:**\nThe specific problem addressed in this paper is the representation density problem in gloss-free SLT. The representation density problem arises because SLT models without gloss annotations struggle to discern and differentiate between visually similar sign gestures that have different meanings. This issue results in poor performance in both sign language recognition and translation tasks. The authors aim to systematically investigate this problem and propose a solution that can alleviate the identified issue, thereby enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of gloss-free SLT models.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\n1. **Gloss-based SLT Methods:** A number of studies have enhanced SLT by relying on intermediate representations or gloss annotations (Camgoz et al., 2018; Yin and Read, 2020; Zhou et al., 2021a; Chen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a; Ye et al., 2023b). Gloss annotations help in learning better visual representations by providing a simplified and sequential structure to the gestures.\n2. **Gloss-free SLT Methods:** Recently, there has been a trend towards developing gloss-free SLT methods (Yin et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2024) which do not utilize gloss annotations. These methods typically leverage general datasets, general pretraining strategies, or large-scale foundation models. However, these approaches face substantial challenges due to the semantic gap between the general domain and the specialized domain of sign languages, resulting in suboptimal performance (Ye et al., 2023a; Kan et al., 2022).\n3. **Representation Density in SLT:** The intricacies of sign languages, such as intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements, imply that similar visual representations might be generated for semantically distinct gestures. This problem has been noted in other studies regarding the nature of visual-gestural communication (Pizzuto, 2003; Vinson et al., 2010).\n4. **Feature Extraction Methods:** Previous works have used various sign feature extraction methods in SLT, both gloss-based (Camgoz et al., 2018; Min et al., 2021) and gloss-free (Yin et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). The investigation in this paper reveals that the representation density problem is more severe in gloss-free methods due to the absence of gloss guidance.\n\nOverall, the paper seeks to address the limitations of current gloss-free SLT approaches by proposing a novel contrastive learning strategy called SignCL, which aims to mitigate the representation density problem and improve SLT performance.",
        "methodology": "The methodology section of the paper addresses the challenge of high representation density in existing sign language feature extraction techniques and explores how this influences sign language recognition and translation performance. Key components of the proposed method include:\n\n1. **Categorization of Existing Methods:**\n   - Existing feature extraction techniques are divided into gloss-based and gloss-free methods. Examples include:\n     - Gloss-based: Sign Recognition Pretrained (SRP) and Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation (SMKD).\n     - Gloss-free: I3D Pretraining (I3D) and Visual-Language Pretraining (VLP).\n\n2. **Sign Density Ratio (SDR):**\n   - Inspired by Fisher\u2019s Discriminant Ratio, the paper introduces the Sign Density Ratio (SDR) to measure representation density.\n   - **Formulas for SDR:**\n     - Inter-Gloss Distance (\\(d_{ij}\\)) and Intra-Gloss Distance (\\(d_i\\)):\n       \\[\n       d_{ij} = \\text{Distance between two glosses} \\, g_i \\, \\text{and} \\, g_j\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       \\text{avg.} \\, d_i = \\text{Average distance of} \\, g_i \\, \\text{to all other glosses}\n       \\]\n     - The formulas for calculating intra and inter-gloss distances involve the number of instances in each gloss and the Euclidean distance between instances.\n\n3. **CTC Classifier for Alignment:**\n   - A Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) classifier is used to align input frames with gloss categories.\n   - Volunteers select the best frame to optimize alignment, ensuring comprehensive mapping.\n\n4. **Benchmark Datasets:**\n   - The PHOENIX-2014T benchmark is chosen for its rich collection of open-source sign features.\n   - t-SNE is used to visualize feature distribution and investigate representation density.\n\n5. **Evaluation Framework:**\n   - NSLT (Sign Language Transformer) serves as the foundational model for evaluations.\n   - Two main tasks are evaluated:\n     - **Sign Language Recognition (SLR):** Measuring recognition accuracy of different sign gestures.\n     - **Sign Language Translation (SLT):** Using BLEU-4 scores to measure translation performance.\n   - Sign features include SRP, SMKD, I3D, VLP, and VLP+SignCL, tested within different translation frameworks (NSLT and NSLT+SignCL).\n\nThis methodology aims to systematically address and mitigate representation density issues in sign language translation, thereby enhancing both recognition and translation accuracies.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Experiment Setup:**\nFor the main experiment, we aim to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed SignCL method in reducing representation density and improving gloss-free sign language translation performance. We integrate SignCL into two different frameworks:\n\n1. **Sign Language Transformer (Camgoz et al., 2020a):** This model has been used in prior research to analyze the problem of representation density in sign language translation.\n2. **GFSLT-VLP (Zhou et al., 2023):** A robust contemporary gloss-free baseline framework that enhances sign language translation (SLT) via pretraining and finetuning.\n\n**Datasets:**\nDetails about the specific datasets used for these experiments are not provided in the text snippets, but it is implied that the same datasets used in the reference frameworks (Camgoz et al., 2020a and Zhou et al., 2023) are likely applied here for a consistent comparison.\n\n**Baselines:**\n- Sign Language Transformer (without SignCL): This serves as the initial baseline to understand the representation density problem and measure improvements brought by SignCL.\n- GFSLT-VLP (without SignCL): This is another baseline that integrates newer methods for improving SLT without the proposed SignCL.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\nWhile the text snippets do not specify the evaluation metrics, standard metrics for sign language translation, such as BLEU scores or similar translation quality metrics, are likely used to measure performance improvements.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\nThe integration of SignCL into both the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP frameworks is evaluated for its impact on representation density and translation performance, comparing directly against their versions without SignCL. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of SignCL in reducing representation density and boosting translation performance, but specific results (such as numerical improvements or statistical significance) are not provided in the given text.\n\nThese setups and results indicate that SignCL shows promise in addressing key challenges in gloss-free sign language translation according to the tests conducted on established models and frameworks."
