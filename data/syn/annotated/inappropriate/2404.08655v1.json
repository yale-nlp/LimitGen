    "title": "Transformer-based Joint Modelling for Automatic Essay Scoring and Off-Topic Detection",
    "abstract": "Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are widely popular in the market as they constitute a cost-effective and time-effective option for grading systems. Nevertheless, many studies have demonstrated that the AES system fails to assign lower grades to irrelevant responses. Thus, detecting the off-topic response in automated essay scoring is crucial in practical tasks where candidates write unrelated text responses to the given task in the question. In this paper, we are proposing an unsupervised technique that jointly scores essays and detects off-topic essays. The proposed Automated Open Essay Scoring (AOES) model uses a novel topic regularization module (TRM), which can be attached on top of a transformer model, and is trained using a proposed hybrid loss function. After training, the AOES model is further used to calculate the Mahalanobis distance score for off-topic essay detection. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline we created and earlier conventional methods on two essay-scoring datasets in off-topic detection as well as on-topic scoring. Experimental evaluation results on different adversarial strategies also show how the suggested method is robust for detecting possible human-level perturbations.\n\n\n\nKeywords:\u2009Automated Essay Scoring, Off-Topic Detection, Transformer, Automated Open Essay Scoring.",

            "text": "Writing assessments are used in many business and academic institutions to measure the written language competency of prospective employees or students, and AES are often widely used to automate the grading process. The candidates are assessed based on the written essay by taking multiple factors into consideration, such as grammar usage, choice of word style to convey the central idea, ability to write a coherent piece of text, factuality, relevance, etc. In spite of many deep learning and transformer-based methods Yang et al. (2020  ###reference_b21###); Wang et al. (2022  ###reference_b19###) showing high human-level agreement scores with these AES systems,  Kabra et al. (2022  ###reference_b6###); Parekh et al. (2020  ###reference_b13###); Ding et al. (2020  ###reference_b2###); Perelman (2020  ###reference_b14###) have showcased that many automated scoring systems are vulnerable to an adversarial attack by the test-taker. Specifically,  Kabra et al. (2022  ###reference_b6###) has showcased that different state-of-the-art AES methods suffer from adversarial responses and fail to provide a low score for them. Moreover, we found that adding unrelated content improved the scores.  Parekh et al. (2020  ###reference_b13###) has showcased that AES is overstable (large change in input essay response but little or no change in output score). For instance, some candidates could attempt to write a planned response that is unrelated to the question in an effort to inflate their score. These unrelated responses are not related to the question prompt and should not be graded more than zero on the content score. It is crucial to develop an efficient assessment scoring system that can flag these responses in order to validate the assessment scores and maintain trustworthiness.\nIn the real scenario, these off-topic responses might arise from a wide variety of sources. Furthermore, using a supervised approach for training a model to classify whether the response is on-topic or off-topic will not generalize well  Xu et al. (2021  ###reference_b20###), as collecting off-topic responses with every possible combination is not practically possible.\nBased on the success of the transformer-based model Yang et al. (2020  ###reference_b21###); Wang et al. (2022  ###reference_b19###); Ludwig et al. (2021  ###reference_b10###) in natural language understanding, we used the BERT Devlin et al. (2018  ###reference_b1###) model for this study. In this paper, we present an approach that can be jointly used for essay grading and off-topic detection. We propose the AOES model with an additional regularization branch, that calibrates the regression output of the model. We further showcased that the proposed architecture with Mahalanobis distance can be utilized for both essay scoring and off-topic essay detection. Additional testing on the adversarial test cases demonstrates that this approach is immune to detecting adversarial responses. So, the proposed model offers a useful compromise whereby humans just need to assess a few samples that have been indicated by the detector models in suspicion of cheating or mischievous activity. Our contributions in this paper are listed below:\nWe propose a novel multi-task joint AOES model that can be used to jointly score the on-topic essay and detect off-topic responses, unlike previous methods where separate models are used for essay score estimation and off-topic text detection.\nWe present a Mahalanobis distance-based unsupervised approach for off-topic detection that does not require additional off-topic data during training.\nWe evaluate our method on two essay datasets, ASAP-AES, an open source dataset, and PsyW-Essay, an in-house industrial dataset, and have also shown that AOES can consistently improve upon baseline methods and previous supervised, unsupervised state-of-the-art methods.\nWe also evaluate our method on various off-topic adversarial perturbations and show effectiveness in the detection of these adversarial samples."

            "text": "In recent years, there has been some research work on off-topic detection. Off-topic Detection has been explored in both supervised and unsupervised settings for both essay and transcribed spoken responses. There are very few works done in unsupervised settings particularly.\nWe begin with an unsupervised method  Louis and Higgins (2010  ###reference_b9###) who proposed two methods that expand the short question prompt with the words most likely to appear in the essay with respect to that prompt after applying spelling correction in the response text. After that, they compared the similarity between the response essay and corresponding question prompt to detect the off-topic essay.\nIn supervised methods,  Wang et al. (2019  ###reference_b18###) suggested a method that first creates a similarity grid for each pair of responses and its corresponding question prompt. This similarity grid will be then fed into the Inception net to classify whether the response belongs to that prompt or not.  Shahzad and Wali (2022  ###reference_b16###) proposed a method by combining idf weighted word, average word embeddings, and word mover distance embedding vectors together and then trained a random forest classifier for detection.  Yoon et al. (2017  ###reference_b22###) proposed an automatic filtering model that uses both a set of linguistic features like vocabulary, and grammar skills and document semantic similarity features based on word hypotheses and content models to detect off-topic responses. A subset of the features listed was also leveraged by other studies, including  Huang et al. (2018  ###reference_b4###) and  Lee et al. (2017  ###reference_b8###), to access similarity between questions and responses, and these features were subsequently used to train deep networks.  Raina et al. (2020  ###reference_b15###) combined Hierarchical attention based topic model (HATM) and Similarity Grid model (SGM) for off-topic spoken essay detection.  Malinin et al. (2016  ###reference_b11###) proposed a Question Topic Adaptive RNNLM framework that learns to associate candidate responses to given questions with samples in a topic space constructed using these responses only.\nBut According to the latest study Singla et al. (2021  ###reference_b17###), most of these previous off-topic detection models cannot detect adversarial samples."

We make use of this fact and provide a Mahalanobis distance-based method for a transformer-based model to detect off-topic text since the improved performance is due to a more valid and reliable feature representation  Hsu et al.

As explored in work Jawahar et al.

Then, mean and covariance of training data, are estimated by the following equations.\nwhere, for -th layer of the model, is extracted latent feature vector of -th training data sample and are corresponding means, covariances of the feature vectors from all training data samples.\nThe calculated and are further used to calculate Euclidean distance at the inference time on the test set, . is the -th layer Euclidean distance of -th test data sample during inference.\nNow, the Euclidean distance score, is calculated by summing layer-wise Euclidean distances up across all layers for the -th test data sample.

            "text": "We experimented with several perturbation techniques discussed in previous studies Kabra et al. (2022  ###reference_b6###); Ding et al. (2020  ###reference_b2###) to generate adversarial examples, vulnerable to current AES systems. Here, we use the suggested method to detect these adversarial input samples to check the robustness of our model against these perturbations.\nMore details on these perturbation techniques are given below.\nAddSpeech - As per Kabra et al. (2022  ###reference_b6###) study, we extracted speech from the famous leader into the test responses and created the off-topic response by adding these irrelevant speech sentences to the test response. According to our qualitative study of experiment results, the number of sentences added in the AddSpeech adversarial transformation affects the overall detection scores. We observed that off-topic responses which have a very high number of speech sentences are hard to detect using our framework.\nBabelGenerate - We use B.S. Essay Language Generator (BABEL) Perelman (2020  ###reference_b14###) to generate gibberish samples from some keywords which we manually created for each prompt. We manually created these keywords for each prompt by looking at important and relevant words found in on-topic samples of the corresponding prompt.\nThese keywords are used to generate an incoherent, meaningless passage containing a concoction of obscure words and keywords concatenated together.\nRepeatSent - In order to make responses longer without going off-topic and to create coherent paragraphs, students often deliberately repeat sentences or particular keywords. To create such responses, we randomly sample sentences and repeat them an arbitrary number of times and add them back to the response. According to our qualitative study of experiment results, the number of times sentences are repeated in the PsyW dataset is comparatively low, making it relatively difficult to classify as off-topic, as few repeated sentences imply adversarial and the input essays are very similar.\nReplaceSents - Another common strategy to bluff an exam is to write something unrelated in the middle of the essay, while the initial and final parts are on topic. We simulate this by substituting other off-topic responses only for the body paragraphs of the responses, keeping the first and last sentences on-topic.\nGPTGenerate - It is possible to generate essays through generative models like 111https://huggingface.co/gpt2GPT-2 and 222https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7BGPT-Neo-2.7b that may appear to be well-written and on-topic but are actually off-topic and irrelevant. This technique can be used to bluff an exam by submitting a seemingly coherent essay that does not actually answer the question. We generated an essay from the GPT-based models on the given prompts to verify that our system can detect AI-generated coherent off-topic essays.\nAccording to Table 8  ###reference_###, it is prominent that our proposed method can effectively distinguish these adversarial responses. As the babel-generated essays based on keywords are irrelevant and incoherent, Mahalanobis distance can effectively distinguish these generated responses. Similarly, responses with unrelated content in body paragraphs are also distinguished effectively."

For off-topic detection, we use the Mahalanobis distance score, which greatly enhances the detection ability and lowers computational costs. We have also shown on two datasets that our method can detect adversarial samples effectively without compromising on-topic performance.\nIn the future, we will investigate more with long-formers and other methods to effectively encode long essay corpora in vector space to improve essay scoring and off-topic performance."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe motivation for this paper stems from the growing need for reliable and accurate Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems in academic and business settings. These systems aim to accurately assess the written language competency of individuals, considering factors like grammar, coherence, relevance, and factuality. However, existing AES methods, despite their advancements, suffer from significant drawbacks. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For instance, test-takers can manipulate their essay responses by including unrelated content to artificially inflate their scores or produce off-topic responses that still achieve high scores, undermining the credibility of the assessment process.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe core research problem addressed in this paper is twofold:\n1. **Essay Scoring Under Adversarial Conditions**: To develop a robust AES system that can provide accurate scoring even when faced with adversarial responses designed to manipulate scores.\n2. **Off-Topic Detection**: To effectively identify and flag off-topic essay responses, which are irrelevant to the prompt and should receive a score of zero for content. This challenge is compounded by the impracticality of collecting extensive off-topic training data to cover all possible variations.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Deep Learning and Transformer-based AES Methods**: Yang et al. (2020) and Wang et al. (2022) have achieved high human-level agreement scores with transformer-based AES systems.\n2. **Vulnerability to Adversarial Attacks**: Several studies, including Kabra et al. (2022), Parekh et al. (2020), Ding et al. (2020), and Perelman (2020), have identified that existing AES systems are susceptible to adversarial responses, often resulting in inflated scores for unrelated content.\n   - **Kabra et al. (2022)**: Demonstrated that state-of-the-art AES methods fail to properly penalize adversarial responses.\n   - **Parekh et al. (2020)**: Highlighted the issue of overstable AES systems where significant changes in essay content result in minimal changes to the output score.\n3. **Off-Topic Detection Challenges**: Xu et al. (2021) suggested that supervised approaches for off-topic classification do not generalize well due to the impracticality of collecting comprehensive off-topic data.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nThe authors propose a novel, transformer-based AOES (Automated Essay Scoring and Off-Topic Essay Detection) model. Their main contributions include:\n1. **Multi-task Joint Model**: Introducing a multi-task joint model that performs both essay scoring and off-topic detection simultaneously, unlike previous methods requiring separate models.\n2. **Unsupervised Off-Topic Detection**: Utilizing a Mahalanobis distance-based approach for unsupervised off-topic detection, eliminating the need for additional off-topic data during training.\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**: Testing the model on two datasets - ASAP-AES and PsyW-Essay - and demonstrating its superiority over baseline and state-of-the-art methods in both supervised and unsupervised settings.\n4. **Robust Adversarial Detection**: The model effectively detects adversarial perturbations, offering a practical solution to flag potentially manipulated responses for human review.\n\nBy addressing these gaps, the AOES model aims to provide a more trustworthy and accurate essay scoring system, enhancing the reliability of writing assessments.",
        "methodology": "The paper introduces a Transformer-based Joint Modelling method for Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and Off-Topic Detection (OTD), incorporating several key components and innovations as described in the methodology section.\n\n**Key Components and Innovations:**\n\n1. **Multi-Task Learning**: The method leverages multi-task learning by utilizing both essay scoring and off-topic detection tasks. The training data is predominantly composed of on-topic text data, which aids the model in learning specialized features pertinent to valid essay scoring while concurrently identifying off-topic responses.\n\n2. **Additional Regularization**: Alongside the conventional regression loss used for scoring, an additional regularization term is integrated. This extra regularization is imposed as a constraint on the final prediction score, aimed at enhancing the performance specifically for on-topic essay scoring. This suggests a more stringent validation of the predicted scores to ensure they reflect genuine assessment criteria.\n\n3. **Mahalanobis Distance-Based Off-Topic Detection**: For detecting off-topic essays, the model incorporates a Mahalanobis distance-based method. The Mahalanobis distance is employed to determine the degree of deviation of a given essay from the learned on-topic feature distribution. This approach is predicated on the assumption that a well-trained transformer model yields valid and reliable feature representations, thereby facilitating the identification of essays that are off-topic.\n\n4. **Terminology**: The proposed method is called the Automated Open Essay Scoring (AOES) System. This terminology helps in distinctly identifying and referring to the presented methodology within the wider context of essay scoring and off-topic detection research.\n\nOverall, the Transformer-based Joint Modelling for Automatic Essay Scoring and Off-Topic Detection aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of essay scoring by combining sophisticated feature learning with robust off-topic detection mechanisms.",
