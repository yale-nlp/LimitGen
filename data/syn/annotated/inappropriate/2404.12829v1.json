    "title": "LiMe: a Latin Corpus of Late Medieval Criminal Sentences",
    "abstract": "The Latin language has received attention from the computational linguistics research community, which has built, over the years, several valuable resources, ranging from detailed annotated corpora to sophisticated tools for linguistic analysis. With the recent advent of large language models, researchers have also started developing models capable of generating vector representations of Latin texts. The performances of such models remain behind the ones for modern languages, given the disparity in available data. In this paper, we present the LiMe dataset, a corpus of 325 documents extracted from a series of medieval manuscripts called Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani, and thoroughly annotated by experts, in order to be employed for masked language model, as well as supervised natural language processing tasks.\n\n\n\nKeywords:\u2009latin corpus, medieval case law, natural language processing",

            "text": "The manuscripts called Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani, preserved at the Archivio Storico Civico and Biblioteca Trivulziana in Milan, Cimeli, 146-152, represent all that remains of the documentation recorded in the late medieval period at the court of justice of the city of Milan. The seven manuscripts of the series cover the activity of the court during the years 1385, 1390-1392, 1397-1398, 1398-1399, 1400-1401, 1427 and 1428-1429, respectively, resulting in the delivery of approximately 3,000 criminal sentences111Throughout the article, the term \u201csentence\u201d will be used with its meaning of a punishment that a judge gives to someone who has committed a crime. discussed in the presence of the Milanese judges, pronounced by the podest\u00e0222A chief magistrate of a medieval Italian town. and publicly recorded by the notaries who worked at the court in the Loggia degli Osii333A historical building of Milan, from whose balcony sentences and edicts were proclaimed by the Milanese judges.. Although, as evident, the chronological span of each Liber varies considerably according to the length of time each podest\u00e0 was in office, the structure, the material aspect and even the form employed in the drafting of these manuscripts present elements of a certain homogeneity and uniformity. This is due to the fact that the notaries in charge of assisting mayors and judges during trials recorded the sentences according to a pattern that is repeated almost unchanged in all manuscripts.\nEach verdict, preceded by the verbal invocation - In nomine Domini, amen444In the name of the Lord, amen. - is pronounced by the podest\u00e0 in accordance with the seigniorial decrees and statutes of the municipality of Milan. It contains the names of the accused, the narration of the legal proceeding, whether it was an inquisitio or an accusation, with the salient phases of the trial and the final pronouncement. In addition to the sentences, whose pattern is formally identical for all defendants, there are also numerous subsequent interventions: e.g. annotations relating to receipts for full or partial payment of penalties or cancellations of sentences.\nThe Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani are pivotal sources for law historians, like all Medieval and Early Modern trial outcomes preserved in the European archives: they allow us to measure the distance between the discipline established by statuta and ius comune and its actual application before the courts of medieval cities (Padoa-Schioppa, 2017  ###reference_b33###). Indeed, the seven Libri photograph the complex balance of social and political forces that characterised the city of Milan during the Visconti rule (Gamberini, 2014  ###reference_b21###).\nThis documentary typology constitutes a source of great importance for historians of medieval law (Storti, 2021  ###reference_b42###; Valsecchi, 2021  ###reference_b45###; Bassani, 2021  ###reference_b3###; Isotton, 2021  ###reference_b25###; Bianchi Riva, 2021  ###reference_b7###; Minnucci, 2021  ###reference_b31###), meanwhile fulfilling the same function for medievalists tout court. It provides inspiration for those who deal with political and institutional history, since it allows one to investigate in practice the dynamics of the exercise and management of power, the men, the methods and timing through which justice is administered, including through the selection of judges (Pagnoni, 2021  ###reference_b34###); at the same time, a collection of sentences issued by a city lord provides very useful elements for the study of society and economy, through the analysis and reconstruction of the type of crime, its scene and circumstances, the weapons used, the profiles of the people involved, including their reputation, qualification and profession.\nIn this article, we present the LiMe dataset, an annotated Latin corpus consisting of 325 judicial documents from the first volume of the Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani. We illustrate the process undertaken for digitizing the documents and annotating them with detailed information, such as entities and relations, in order to make the manuscript more accessible and valuable to researchers. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2  ###reference_### provides the motivations behind this research; Section 3  ###reference_### outlines relative contributions in the field literature; in Section 4  ###reference_### we define how the data has been extracted and the final structure of the LiMe dataset; Section 5  ###reference_### gives examples of possible statistical and machine learning applications; in Section 6  ###reference_### we discuss the results and the future steps."

At the same time, the registers of sentences still preserved in the archives of Italian cities of the last centuries of the Middle Ages, constitute a valuable field of research for those who deal with the history of gender in the medieval age (Del Bo, 2021  ###reference_b16###; Dean, 2008  ###reference_b15###). The analysis of such documentation on the basis of the interpretative categories typical of this historiography benefits from the possibility of questioning the source on the characteristics of alleged victims and perpetrators, the type of condemnation/absolution, the granting of pardon (gratia), the timing of the execution of the sentence, the type of crime, the weapons used, the place and circumstances of the offence (delictum), single or group action, the presence of accomplices or leaders and their gender, the personal/familial condition, the words used to identify and define each person, to mention only a few aspects of the research. Starting from the identification modalities of women and men from the language of sentences, exploiting qualifying attributes, the source offers the possibility of dismantling stereotypes and historiographical clich\u00e9s.\nDespite their undoubted relevance, the Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani have received little, if any, historiographical attention overall. In fact, they have not been taken into account in wide-ranging studies dedicated to the subject of the documentation issued by medieval Italian judicial bodies (Giorgi et al., 2012  ###reference_b22###; Lett, 2021  ###reference_b28###; Dean, 2007  ###reference_b14###; Vallerani, 2012  ###reference_b44###) and, until very recent years, few scholars have dealt with them specifically (Verga, 1901  ###reference_b46###; Santoro, 1968  ###reference_b40###; Padoa-Schioppa, 1996  ###reference_b32###; Covini, 2012  ###reference_b13###). The first manuscript in the series contains 126 criminal sentences pronounced by the podest\u00e0 of Milan Carlo Zen (1385). This manuscript was recently edited by (Pizzi, 2021  ###reference_b37###) and analysed in (Bassani et al., 2021  ###reference_b4###)."

            "text": "The main source of information in the manuscript are the criminal sentences, gathered in dossiers and ordered according to an arbitrary number given from the curator, e.g. Sentenza I.1 refers to the first (1) judgment from the first (I) dossier. Each dossier is usually opened by a \u201cprotocol\u201d, i.e., a textual section in which the notary explicitly declares his identity and announces, following a very precise formulary, the name of the judge and podest\u00e0 who presided over the trials. The \u201ceschatocol\u201d is the section closing each dossier, where the notary refers to the group of judgments he has transcribed, citing the witnesses present. Additionally, there are three other types of sources, constituting supplementary information to the judgements: an \u201caddendum\u201d is a document added later to the text of the judgment, indicating further developments happened after the end of the trial; an \u201cinsert\u201d is a piece of text, reported within a judgment or addendum, usually certifying orders received from the podest\u00e0; finally, a \u201cnews\u201d is an indirect evidence of an order or document that existed at the time but was not transcribed, useful in justifying decisions made by authority or actions taken by officials.\nThe texts of criminal sentences, being them legal texts (thus with a rigid structure and a content pattern based on formulas), present the same sections and reflect a precise and largely stable structure. At the beginning, sometimes there it lies the significatio, i.e., the communication of the misdemeanor(s) to the podest\u00e0 by a faithworthy person, the elder of the parish, in charge of the surveillance of a living area; this communication, however, did not always occur, so it is not always found in the text. The following part of the judgment, the inquisitio, narrates the events that occurred as they were reconstructed: here, the details regarding each misdemeanor (misfatto) are reported, such as the criminal offences, the perpetrator of the violence, the victim and any item involved. The motivational section (motivazioni), usually introduced by the words qua de causa (\u201cthe cause of\u201d), et predicta (\u201cand the aforesaid\u201d) or et constat nobis (\u201cand it is agreed with us\u201d), states the reason why the verdict was reached. Finally, the last part of the sentence consists of the decision (dispositivo) of conviction or acquittal and, in the former case, also of the type and amount of punishment; it generally begins with the word idcirco (\u201ctherefore\u201d, \u201cabout that\u201d). A summary of the structure of a typical dossier with details on the form of a judgment is depicted in Figure 1  ###reference_###.\n###figure_1### The text of each source, strictly written in Latin language, has been thoroughly studied by experts, combining the findings extracted from the text with their domain knowledge in order to provide accurate and detailed annotations about people, places and items. For each person involved in the facts, demographic and social information have been identified: name and nicknames, biological gender, social class (dominus), profession, place of origin or residency, possible relationships with relatives, and roles played in the events. For instance, we know that Laurentius de Roncho, also referred to as Beleius and son of Belollus, was murdered in March 1385 by Iohanollus de Raude, also known as Barachinus.\nKnowledge about places is important to understand where crimes were being committed and the geographical origin of the criminals: places inside the city regard the parochiae (parishes) and portae (gates), that were used to divide the territory of Milan; places outside the city are used for both towns under the jurisdiction of Milan, and for cities inside or outside of Italy; finally, generic places are used to indicate where a misdemeanor has taken place, e.g., a public street or a private house. The murderer of Laurentius de Roncho took place in a public street near its residency, in Parochia Sancti Babile foris, Porta Horientalis.\nWithin the narrative of a criminal event, it is possible to read about items used within an assault or that had been stolen by pickpockets, along with the indication of the body parts struck or striking. Additionally, for stolen artifacts, it is also specified their value, expressed in the currency of the time. For example, Iohanollus de Raude struck Laurentius de Roncho dead in the occipital bone (in capite de retro) with a tuck (stocho), an ancient type of longsword.

            "text": "The annotation activity has been performed by a team of domain experts, that defined and mutually agreed on the custom guidelines followed throughout the entire process. The resulting dataset consists of a collection of 325 documents, of which most comprise the Latin text, the document type, named entities, events, relations, and text segmentation labels.\nThe documents are classified according to the six document types identified at the beginning of the previous section; the counts of documents for each type is reported in Table 1  ###reference_###.\nObjects under the \u201cnews\u201d type, given the fact that they are orders or information from non transcribed documents, do not have any text; thus, knowledge about \u201cnews\u201d can be indirectly acquired from the text of another object they refer to, usually an \u201caddendum\u201d. However, this knowledge is still reported in the \u201cnews\u201d object in order to keep it logically distinct from the others.\nIn each document, there are eight types of named entity recognised: \u201cPERSON\u201d (e.g. Laurentius de Roncho), \u201cPLACE\u201d (Parochia Sancti Babile foris), \u201cDATE\u201d (01/03/1385-31/03/1385), \u201cITEM\u201d (stocho), \u201cANIMAL\u201d (equum brunum, brown horse), \u201cMEASURE\u201d (valoris, value), \u201cUNITY OF MEASURE\u201d (librarum imperialum, imperial pounds), \u201cQUANTITY\u201d (viginti quinque, twenty-five). For some of them, further sub-types have been defined, such as \u201cGIVEN NAME\u201d and \u201cNICKNAME\u201d for \u201cPERSON\u201d, or \u201cCITY\u201d and \u201cCHURCH\u201d for \u201cPLACE\u201d. The counts of named entities types and subtypes is reported in Table 2  ###reference_###; since the same named entity can occur in multiple documents, the counts refer to the unique occurrences in the entire dataset.\nEvents are the most complex structure in the dataset; each of them is characterised of a type, usually of a subtype, and one or more arguments. There are 5 types of events: \u201cTRIAL STAGE\u201d, \u201cTRIAL INTEGRATION\u201d, \u201cESCHATOCOL\u201d, \u201cOFFENCES\u201d, and \u201cDEATH\u201d. A type of event may have one or multiple subtypes, for a total of 37 event subtypes: for example, an event of type \u201cOFFENCES\u201d may be, among others, of subtype \u201cINSULT\u201d, \u201cMURDER\u201d or \u201cTHEFT\u201d. Depending on its type and subtype, an event has a different set of attributes, each of them having a role and an entity playing that role: in a \u201cTHEFT\u201d event, we expect to have a time and place of the event, a victim, a thief, and the object or quantity of money stolen.\n###figure_2### Relations between entities are defined by a triple of the form (\u201cENTITY1\u201d, \u201cPREDICATE\u201d, \u201cENTITY2\u201d), where \u201cENTITY1\u201d is one of the named entities or events, \u201cPREDICATE\u201d defines the type of relation, and \u201cENTITY2\u201d can be a named entity (or event) or a group. For instance, Laurentius de Roncho isSonOf Belollus or Laurentius de Roncho hasBiologicalGender Male. In the dataset there are 37 unique predicates, which define 3397 unique relations.\nFinally, for documents of type \u201csentences\u201d, the text has been divided into segments, each of them classified with a label that specifies the section in which they appear, according to the annotation schema defined in the previous section: significatio, inquisitio, motivazioni, dispositivo. The segments are outlined by a starting and ending index, enclosing a specific span of text.\nAn example of all the annotations that can be found in a text is portrayed in Figure 2  ###reference_###: this shows the amount of details that can be extracted even from a very short piece of text, like the one presented."

The LiMe dataset proves how the digitisation and annotation of these kinds of sources allow for a methodological and technical analysis of the data, thanks to the usage of statistical and machine learning tools. In the future, we expect to: exploit the current dataset for more complex tasks, such as named entity recognition or event extraction; increase the number of annotated documents, with information coming from subsequent volumes of the Libri, which are currently being examined by experts; extend the current annotations with features at syntactical and morphological levels."

        "research_background": "**Motivation:**\nThe primary motivation behind the paper is the preservation and accessibility of historically significant legal documents from the late medieval period in Milan. The manuscripts called *Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani* are crucial as they provide a window into the judicial proceedings and socio-political dynamics of Milan during the Visconti rule. These documents are invaluable for historians who study medieval law, political institutions, society, and economy. The challenge lies in making these rich historical sources more accessible and useful to researchers through digitization and detailed annotation.\n\n**Research Problem:**\nThe research problem addressed by the paper involves creating an annotated Latin corpus from the judicial documents found in the first volume of the *Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani*. The task includes digitizing the manuscripts, annotating them with detailed information about entities and relationships, and structuring the data in a way that enhances accessibility and analytical use for historians and other researchers. The paper aims to describe the digitization and annotation process comprehensively and demonstrate the potential applications of the resulting dataset.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\nThe introduction references prior studies emphasizing the significance of medieval trial records. Particularly, it names several scholars and their contributions to understanding medieval law and institutional practice:\n- **Padoa-Schioppa (2017)** discusses the juxtaposition of statutory law (statuta) and common law (ius comune) with their actual application in medieval courts.\n- **Gamberini (2014)** highlights the interplay of social and political forces in Milan during the Visconti rule.\n- Contributions by **Storti (2021), Valsecchi (2021), Bassani (2021), Isotton (2021), Bianchi Riva (2021),** and **Minnucci (2021)** underscore the importance of trial records for medieval law historians.\n- **Pagnoni (2021)** investigates the practical aspects of power dynamics and justice administration in medieval settings.\n\nThis body of work establishes the scholarly relevance and necessity of the digitization and annotation project presented in the paper.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology: LiMe: a Latin Corpus of Late Medieval Criminal Sentences\n\n#### Overview\n\nLiMe is a publicly available Latin corpus that includes not only criminal sentences but also numerous additional notes. These were collected from the first manuscript of the \"Liber sententiarum potestatis Mediolani\" (1385-1429), which stands as the oldest known register of criminal sentences for Milan. The original manuscript is notably well-preserved, with only three texts missing parts, and it has been edited and transcribed in a curated edition (Pizzi, 2021).\n\n#### Digitization and Annotation\n\nThe text has been digitized and annotated as part of the FAITH (Fight Against Injustice Through Humanities) project. This project aims to provide standardized tools and methodologies for collecting, digitizing, and integrating various historical resources. Here\u2019s the step-by-step breakdown of the methodology:\n\n1. **Source Editing and Transcription**:\n   - The original manuscripts were first edited and transcribed.\n\n2. **Digitization**:\n   - The transcribed texts were digitized, ensuring the accurate transformation of these historical documents into a digital format.\n\n3. **Annotation**:\n   - Named entities, the relationships between them, and events within the documents were manually identified.\n   - Experts classified the texts based on the document type.\n   - For criminal sentences, segmentation was performed according to a predefined annotation schema.\n\n#### Resulting Dataset\n\nThe final result of this meticulous process is a collection of 325 documents. In total, the corpus comprises 87,110 tokens in Latin. \n\n#### Custom Annotation Schema\n\nThe annotations, executed by a team of experts, have been organized into a custom schema. An example of these annotations is detailed in Section 4.2 of the original document.\n\n#### Innovations and Contributions\n\n- **Integration of Additional Notes**:\n   - The inclusion of additional notes alongside criminal sentences, enriching the context and comprehensive understanding of the documents.\n   \n- **Manual Annotation**:\n   - This involved annotating named entities and their relations, as well as events, thus providing a rich, interlinked dataset.\n   \n- **Segmented Criminal Sentences**:\n   - Criminal sentences have been precisely segmented using a predefined schema, allowing for detailed and structured analysis.\n\n#### FAITH Project Impact\n\nThe FAITH project primarily aims to standardize the methodologies for historical document digitization and annotation, thus facilitating the seamless integration of different historical sources.\n\nOverall, LiMe harnesses a rigorous process of transcription, digitization, and expert annotation, resulting in a meticulously curated Latin corpus that stands to significantly contribute to historical and linguistic research.",
