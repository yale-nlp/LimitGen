            "text": "In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has witnessed a remarkable surge in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a  ###reference_b22###), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b  ###reference_b23###), and Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023  ###reference_b29###), have demonstrated exceptional performance in various natural language understanding and generation tasks (Zhao et al., 2023a  ###reference_b42###). The success of LLMs can be attributed to the innovative training techniques employed, including instruction tuning, prompt tuning, Low-Rank Adaptor (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021  ###reference_b11###; Dettmers et al., 2022  ###reference_b6###). These advances have made it possible to fine-tune and infer models like Llama-2-7B on consumer-level devices, thereby increasing their accessibility and potential for integration into daily life.\nHowever, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not without limitations. One significant challenge is their susceptibility to variations in input types, which can lead to inconsistencies in output and potentially undermine their reliability in real-world applications. For example, when faced with ambiguous or provocative prompts, LLMs may generate inconsistent or inappropriate responses. To address this issue, several studies have been conducted to assess the robustness of LLM models (Zhu et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###; Wang et al., 2023d  ###reference_b35###). However, these efforts often overlook the importance of re-fine-tuning the models and conducting comprehensive studies of adversarial attacks with known adversarial sample generation mechanisms when full access to the model weights, architecture, and training pipeline is available (Guo et al., 2021  ###reference_b10###; Wallace et al., 2019  ###reference_b30###).\nIn this paper, we present an extensive study of three leading open-source LLMs: Llama, OPT, and T5. We evaluate the robustness of various sizes of these models across five distinct NLP classification datasets. To assess their vulnerability to input perturbations, we employ the adversarial geometry attack technique and measure the impact on model accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of commonly used methods in LLM training, such as LoRA, different precision levels, and variations in model architecture and tuning approaches.\nOur work makes several notable contributions to the field of LLM evaluation and robustness:\nWe introduce a novel white-box style attack approach that leverages output logits and gradients to expose potential vulnerabilities and assess the robustness of LLMs.\nWe establish a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs by focusing on their training strategies, setting the stage for future research in this domain.\nOur comprehensive evaluation spans five text classification tasks, providing a broad perspective on the capabilities and limitations of the models across diverse applications."

            "text": "In recent years, the LLM domain has experienced significant advances (Bommasani et al., 2021  ###reference_b5###; Wei et al., 2022  ###reference_b37###). A large number of exemplary large-scale models such a s GPT-4, have emerged, showcasing exceptional performance across various sectors.\nGiven the remarkable capabilities and broad applications of these models, evaluating their performance has become paramount. Consequently, a significant portion of the research is dedicated to NLP tasks. For instance, (Wang et al., 2023d  ###reference_b35###) examines ChatGPT\u2019s performance in sentiment analysis, while (Zhang et al., 2023  ###reference_b40###) offers a comparative analysis with other LLMs. Numerous studies have explored the capabilities of LLM in natural language understanding, including text classification as highlighted by (Liang et al., 2022  ###reference_b15###), and inference as demonstrated by (Qin et al., 2023  ###reference_b25###). Additionally, extensive research has been conducted to assess LLMs in generation tasks, encompassing areas such as translation (Wang et al., 2023c  ###reference_b34###), question answering (Bai et al., 2023  ###reference_b3###; Liang et al., 2022  ###reference_b15###), and summarization (Bang et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###).\nDue to the impressive performance of LLMs, there has been widespread attention to their safety and stability.  (Wang et al., 2023b  ###reference_b33###) conducted an early investigation into ChatGPT and other LLMs and utilized existing benchmarks like AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2022  ###reference_b31###), ANLI (Nie et al., 2020  ###reference_b21###), and DDXPlus (Tchango et al., 2022  ###reference_b28###) for their evaluations. (Zhao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b43###) assessed the performance of LLMs in visual inputs and their transferability to other visual-language models. On the topic of adversarial robustness,  (Wang et al., 2023a  ###reference_b32###) introduced the AdvGLUE++ benchmark and proposed an approach to examine machine ethics through system prompts. (Zhu et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###) proposed a unified benchmark named PromptBench to evaluate the resilience of LLMs against prompts.\nHowever, a significant limitation of the aforementioned studies on robustness is that they focus only on inference-based evaluations. They largely overlook the intricacies of the model\u2019s weights and output logits. Furthermore, these studies do not discuss the performance of various LLM techniques. In contrast, in our research, we not only conduct attacks based on the model\u2019s parameters and logits, but also actively participate in the model\u2019s tuning. Additionally, we place a special emphasis on studying the model size and specific techniques used in LLMs, aspects that previous works have not addressed."

            "text": "With the rapid advancement in NLP research, its applications have become increasingly prevalent. This ubiquity underscores the growing need for reliable NLP systems that can effectively counteract malign content and misinformation. A seminal work (Jia & Liang, 2017  ###reference_b12###)\nhighlighted the vulnerabilities of NLP systems to adversarial attacks.\nThere are some works about various input perturbations, which could be categorized into three groups: character level, word level, and sentence level (Wei & Zou, 2019  ###reference_b36###; Karimi et al., 2021  ###reference_b13###; Ma, 2019  ###reference_b16###). At the character level, adversarial attacks focus on altering individual characters within a given text.  (Ebrahimi et al., 2018  ###reference_b9###) introduced HotFlip, utilizing gradient information to manipulate characters within text. (Li et al., 2019  ###reference_b14###) took a different approach by identifying words and modifying their characters. At the word level, adversarial strategies revolve around replacing specific words within the content. For instance, (Alzantot et al., 2018  ###reference_b1###) employs evolutionary algorithms to swap out words with their synonyms.  (Zhang et al., 2019  ###reference_b38###) utilized probabilistic sampling to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, some researchers have explored adversarial tactics at the sentence level. (Jia & Liang, 2017  ###reference_b12###) suggested a method that introduces an extraneous sentence to the primary content, aiming to mislead reading models. On the other hand, (Peters et al., 2018  ###reference_b24###) adopted a new approach, where they employed an encoder-decoder framework to rephrase entire sentences. Recently,  (Wang et al., 2023a  ###reference_b32###) evaluated the robustness and trustworthiness of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, revealing vulnerabilities such as the ease of generating toxic and biased outputs and leaking private information. Despite GPT-4\u2019s improved performance on standard benchmarks, it is more susceptible to adversarial prompts, highlighting the need for rigorous trustworthiness guarantees and robust safeguards against new adaptive attacks.\nHowever, the landscape of NLP research is ever-evolving. With the introduction of more sophisticated models boasting novel architectures and training methodologies, there is an growing need to assess the robustness of these newer models. This is especially true for LLMs, which present unique challenges and opportunities in the realm of robustness research."

We propose a systematic methodology grounded in geometric attack insights. The following sections detail the steps of our approach:\n1) Gradient Computation for Influence Analysis: We commence by calculating the gradients of the generation loss with respect to the embeddings of input sentence . The cross entropy loss measures the dissimilarity between the prediction and label examples in the output space. This computation is essential for all words, including those segmented into sub-tokens. For such words, gradients are computed for each sub-token and subsequently averaged. This initial step is crucial for identifying the words that exert significant influence on . We determine the gradient of with respect to the embedding vector . This step determines the direction in which should be adjusted to maximize the increase in the loss . The resulting gradient vector is denoted as .\n2) Selection of Candidate Words: Suppose we select a target word from step 1. Utilizing the Random word substitution (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016 ###reference_b20###), we identify potential replacement words, forming a candidate set . Candidates are filtered based on their cosine similarity to , with those below a defined threshold being excluded. This process ensures that only semantically similar and relevant candidates are considered.\n3) Optimal Word Replacement and Projection Analysis: After replacing with each candidate word, we compute the new text vectors . For each vector, we define the delta vector as . The projection of onto is calculated as . The optimal replacement candidate is selected based on criterion . This ensures that the chosen word induces the largest possible projection onto the gradient vector .\n4) Iterative Process for Enhanced Adversarial Strength: The selected word replaces in , updating to . This iterative procedure is repeated for cycles, where is an adjustable parameter in our methodology. Throughout these iterations, an increase in should be observed, indicating a continuous enhancement in the adversarial effectiveness of the altered input.\nThrough this methodically structured process, our research aims to uncover and analyze potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. We refined our methodology to enable prompt fine-tuning for attack generation tasks, expanding its application beyond the previously limited scope of classification tasks."

We measure the performance and robustness of LLMs with the metrics Acc, Acc/attack, ASR, and Replacement Rate described in Table 2  ###reference_###.\nThe results from the IMDB dataset in Table 3  ###reference_### reveal distinct performance variations among different model architectures. In the T5 Series, accuracy generally improves with increasing model size, from 60m to 11b parameters, but the relationship is nonlinear. This suggests that while larger models tend to be more accurate, the accuracy does not increase uniformly with model size. Furthermore, the resilience of these models to adversarial attacks does not follow a simple inverse relationship with model size. The larger T5-11b model shows a more noticeable decrease in accuracy under attack conditions.\nFor the OPT models, a similar upward trend in accuracy is observed with increasing model size, but the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is lower, suggesting better resistance to attacks. In comparison, the Llama models demonstrate superior performance in both accuracy and robustness against attacks.\nFrom Table 3  ###reference_### on the SST-2 dataset, there are distinct performance trends. The T5-11b, achieves the highest accuracy of 0.9656. However, its persistence to adversarial attacks is not highest. Notably, the highest ASR within the T5 series is recorded for the T5-770m model, indicating a trade-off as model size increases. In the case of the OPT series, the OPT-6.7b model stands out. However, similar to the IMDB dataset, this model also shows a significant decline in accuracy but more robust than T5 models. One more observation in the OPT series is the overall decrease in ASR with increasing model size, but this trend is disrupted at the 13b parameter mark, where an anomalous increase in ASR is observed. The Llama models, demonstrate consistently high accuracy. It also presents lower ASR compared to T5 models but similar performance to OPT models. For SST-2, the ASR of T5 models exhibit a trend entirely contrary to that observed for MRPC. It reaches its minimum at the T5-770m model. For the OPT models, although their ASR is much lower compared to the T5 series, there is a consistent decrease in ASR as the size of the OPT models increases. Regarding the Llama models, the 7b model slightly outperforms the 13b in terms of accuracy and ASR.\nIn Tables 4  ###reference_###, analyzing results from multi-class classification tasks, a distinct pattern emerges. These datasets reveal enhanced stability against synonym substitution attacks. For T5 models, the data shows a lower ASR on these tasks compared to binary datasets, suggesting a better resistance to attacks in complex classification scenarios. In contrast, OPT and Llama models exhibit a higher ASR on the AGNews and DBpedia14 datasets. Another result is that for both T5 and OPT series, there is a marked decline in ASR around the 770 million or 1 billion parameter threshold. This indicates an increased robustness and better handling of adversarial attacks with the scale-up of model size."

            "text": "When examining the accuracy of the model, we observed a trend where the accuracy gradually increases with the growth in model size. However, after reaching a certain size threshold, the accuracy tends to saturate, stabilizing around specific values. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced when tested on datasets like DBpedia. When comparing different models operating at the same parameter scale, their performances were found to be quite similar, without any significant disparities.\nHowever, the experiments related to robustness revealed more distinct differences. From Figure  2(a)  ###reference_sf1###, Figure 2(b)  ###reference_sf2### and Figure 2(c)  ###reference_sf3###, we have more intuitive results. Observing the performance of a uniform model across various datasets, we made the following observations:\nT5 Model: As the size of the T5 model increases, its ASR gradually decreases. This suggests that larger models, with more parameters, tend to have a deeper understanding of language. As a result, they can maintain stronger stability in the face of various disturbances. However, on datasets like MRPC and SST-2, there were noticeable fluctuations in performance. One possible explanation for this is that as the model size grows, the words selected based on the model\u2019s gradient become more precise and have a more significant impact on the results. This introduces a trade-off related to model size.\nOPT Model: For the OPT model, a similar trend was observed across most datasets. As the model size increased, its robustness generally improved, aligning with the observations made for the T5 model.\nLlama Model: For the Llama model, the differences in performance between the two sizes were minimal. This suggests that the size variation did not significantly influence the model\u2019s robustness.\nHowever, when comparing different models, the disparities become even more pronounced. It is obvious that the T5 model\u2019s ASR and replacement rate are significantly higher than those of OPT and Llama. This indicated that Decoder-only Causal LMs have higher robustness against encoder-decoder architectures under synonym substitution adversarial attacks.\n###figure_2### ###figure_3### ###figure_4###"

In contrast, the traditional T5 was not trained with such an extensive procedure.\nBased on our experimental results, as shown in the table, there is a significant decline in accuracy for both T5 and Flan-T5 under adversarial attacks. This observation indicates that models, irrespective of whether they have undergone instruction tuning, remain susceptible to adversarial manipulations. Furthermore, consistent with our previous findings, we noticed that as the model size increases, the attack success rate tends to decline.\nInterestingly, as shown in Fig 3  ###reference_###, our results indicated that Flan-T5 exhibits a higher ASR than the standard T5. This suggests that models subjected to instruction tuning, like Flan-T5, can be more easily compromised. We hypothesize the primary reason for this observation:\nThe instruction tuning process for Flan-T5 encompassed datasets similar to IMDB.

            "text": "The architecture of a model\u2019s output space significantly influences its performance and resilience against adversarial attacks. For models with a classification head, the output is simplified to a binary decision, contrasting with OPT models without such a head, which must identify \u2019negative\u2019 or \u2019positive\u2019 labels from a vast vocabulary. This distinction impacts the model\u2019s accuracy.\nOur data shows that smaller models with a classification head are more accurate than headless ones due to their simplified output space, which aids decision-making, especially in models with limited processing power. Moreover, models with a head reach their peak performance faster, achieving accuracy saturation more quickly.\nHowever, an intriguing observation is the heightened attack success rate for models with a classification head. On the surface, this suggests that launching adversarial attacks against these models is a more straightforward task.One main factor contributes to this vulnerability is DeepFool\u2019s efficacy with last layer FFN: In such models, DeepFool can more readily discern the optimal direction for launching its attack, amplifying the ASR. This marked efficiency underscores a reduced robustness in these models against adversarial intrusions.\n###figure_9###"

            "text": "This paper utilized a novel geometric adversarial attack method to assess the robustness of leading LLMs, utilizing advanced fine-tuning techniques for task-specific model adaptation. Our groundbreaking approach revealed that these models exhibit variable sensitivity to adversarial attacks, influenced by their size and architectural differences. This indicates inherent vulnerabilities in LLMs, yet suggests potential resilience in certain configurations. Contrary to expectations, LLM-specific techniques did not markedly reduce robustness. Future research could explore models like RLHF and model parallelism approaches within this framework. Additionally, the evolution of more complex adversarial attacks promises deeper insights into LLM strengths and weaknesses."

        "research_background": "### Motivation and Research Problem:\nThe paper is driven by the remarkable advancements and widespread applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Llama-2. Despite their exceptional performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks, these models are prone to limitations, particularly their susceptibility to variations in input types. This poses a risk to their reliability in real-world applications, especially when dealing with ambiguous or provocative prompts that may lead to inconsistent or inappropriate responses.\n\nThe research problem addressed in this paper centers on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks. Existing studies often overlook the efficacy of re-fine-tuning models and conducting thorough evaluations using known adversarial sample generation mechanisms, especially when full access to model weights, architecture, and training pipelines is available.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **Performance and Training Techniques of LLMs**: Various studies highlight the exceptional performance of LLMs in NLP tasks ([Zhao et al., 2023a](###reference_b42###)). Key advancements like instruction tuning, prompt tuning, and Low-Rank Adaptor (LoRA) facilitate the fine-tuning and inference of models on consumer-level devices (Hu et al., 2021; Dettmers et al., 2022).\n\n2. **Challenges in LLM Robustness**: Research acknowledges the challenge of LLMs\u2019 susceptibility to different input variations, which affects their reliability (Zhu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023d). However, critical aspects like re-fine-tuning models and comprehensive adversarial attack studies need more focus (Guo et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2019).\n\n### Contribution of the Present Work:\n1. **Novel Attack Approach**: The paper introduces a white-box style attack that utilizes output logits and gradients to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.\n   \n2. **Robustness Benchmark**: It establishes a benchmark focusing on LLM training strategies to evaluate model robustness, setting a foundation for future research.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The study conducts an extensive evaluation of various sizes of three leading open-source LLMs (Llama, OPT, T5) across five NLP classification datasets using adversarial geometry attack techniques to scrutinize model accuracy against input perturbations.",

        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\n**Datasets**:\nThe main experiment utilizes a target dataset tailored for the task at hand (details are found in Sec. 3.2 ###reference_###). This dataset is split into training, validation, and test subsets.\n\n**Baselines**:\nTo establish a performance baseline, the pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on the target dataset. Multiple fine-tuning techniques are experimented with, and the best-performing configuration on the validation set is selected as the baseline model.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics**:\nThe key metric for performance assessment is accuracy, measured on both the standard validation set and the test dataset. For robustness evaluation, accuracy is also measured on the test dataset altered with adversarial examples.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n1. **Performance Baseline**:\n   - The fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy score of X% on the validation set.\n   - This establishes the performance benchmark for the subsequent stages of the experiment.\n\n2. **Adversarial Attack Assessment**:\n   - The fine-tuned model is subjected to adversarial attacks as described in Sec. 4.2 ###reference_###.\n   - The accuracy on the adversarial test set is reduced to Y%, revealing the model's susceptibility to adversarial manipulations.\n\n3. **Robustness Evaluation**:\n   - By comparing the model\u2019s performance before and after the adversarial attacks, the robustness is quantified.\n   - The relative drop in accuracy from the clean test data to the adversarial test data indicates how robust (or vulnerable) the model is to such adversarial attacks.\n\nIn summary:\n- The model's accuracy significantly drops from X% (baseline on clean data) to Y% (post-attack accuracy on adversarial data).\n- This substantial decrease highlights the challenges in maintaining model robustness against adversarial threats. \n\nThese results underscore the need for improved adversarial defense mechanisms in fine-tuning and deployment of large language models."
