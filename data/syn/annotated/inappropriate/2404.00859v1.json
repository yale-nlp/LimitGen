We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present in training result in the model computing features at  irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step  are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time . We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training.

            "text": "Humans are known to think ahead while speaking; decades of linguistics research (Huettig, 2015  ###reference_b12###; Miller, 1951  ###reference_b15###) have shown evidence that human language users internally predict upcoming language input, words and sometimes sentences ahead (Barthel et al., 2016  ###reference_b1###).\nUnlike humans, contemporary language models allocate a fixed amount of information processing for each token when \u201cspeaking\u201d (Vaswani et al., 2017  ###reference_b27###).\nDo language models, like humans, think ahead? Recent work (Pal et al., 2023  ###reference_b22###; Hernandez et al., 2024  ###reference_b9###; Cai et al., 2024  ###reference_b7###) has shown that tokens beyond the immediate next token can be predicted by probing the hidden state of the language model. Intriguingly, model outputs at future tokens can be predicted to some extent using linear probes on model hidden states, and interventions on hidden states can predictably alter future outputs.\nThese findings indicate that model activations at a given timestep are at least somewhat predictive of future outputs. However, it remains unclear why this might be: is this just a happenstance property of the data, or because the model is deliberately preparing information for future timesteps, at the expense of degrading performance on the current position?\nWe observe that gradients during training optimize weights for both the loss at the current token position as well as for tokens later in the sequence. We question to what extent current transformer weights dedicate resources to the current token vs. allocating it for future tokens.\nWe consider two possibilities: the pre-caching hypothesis, in which the transformer learns to compute features at time step  that are irrelevant to the inference task at that current time step but may be useful for future time steps , and the breadcrumbs hypothesis, in which the features most relevant to time step  are already identical to those that would most benefit inference at time . To evaluate which hypothesis might be correct, we propose a myopic training scheme which does not propagate gradients from the loss at the current position to hidden states from previous positions.\nTo consider whether language models might directly implement pre-caching, we design a synthetic scenario where the task can only be completed via explicit pre-caching. We configure a task where the model must precompute information for the next token, because otherwise the correct answer could not be accurately computed in a single forward pass. In this synthetic scenario, we find clear evidence that the transformer learns to pre-cache. When transformer-based sequence models must precompute information to minimize loss, they do so.\nWe then consider whether breadcrumbs or pre-caching is demonstrated in natural language models (pre-trained GPT-2 variants). Our experiments with myopic training suggest that much less pre-caching occurs in this setting, and thus point towards the breadcrumbs hypothesis.\nOn real language data, we claim language models do not intentionally prepare information for the future to a significant extent. Instead, they compute features that are useful to predicting the immediate next token, which turn out to then be helpful at future steps. In language data, we do not observe a significant tradeoff between greedily optimizing for next token loss and ensuring future predictive performance.\n###figure_1###"

            "text": "Several recent works (nostalgebraist, 2020  ###reference_b20###; Belrose et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###; Pal et al., 2023  ###reference_b22###; Cai et al., 2024  ###reference_b7###) observe that transformer hidden states can be used to predict current and future tokens in a sequence, typically via linear probing. Notably, Hernandez et al. (2024  ###reference_b9###) show that more complicated relationships are encoded linearly in hidden states, such as subject-object relations, implying that future tokens can also be predicted in specific cases. Unlike these works, we consider whether the model is deliberately preparing hidden states that are useful for future prediction, at the expense of current-token predictivity.\nOur experiments make use of probing, a technique where a simple auxiliary model is used to predict properties from target models\u2019 representations (Belinkov & Glass, 2019  ###reference_b5###; Shi et al., 2016  ###reference_b26###; Hewitt & Liang, 2019  ###reference_b10###; Pimentel et al., 2020  ###reference_b23###; Belinkov, 2021  ###reference_b4###). We can also phrase our probing experiments as measuring the -information contained in a representation vector, where  is the class of linear models (Xu et al., 2020  ###reference_b28###; Hewitt & Liang, 2019  ###reference_b10###). Probing-based approaches are known to overestimate latent information if the classifier learns to do a task on its own (Belinkov, 2021  ###reference_b4###), and probing analyses may only be informative when compared to probing a reasonable baseline (Hewitt & Liang, 2019  ###reference_b10###). In our probing experiments, we avoid these pitfalls by ensuring that the function to be learned cannot possibly be computed by the probe itself.\nOur analysis of transformer models in a synthetic setting relates to the subfield of mechanistic interpretability, which seeks to understand models by isolating and explaining the behavior of their components (Olah et al., 2020  ###reference_b21###; Bau et al., 2020  ###reference_b2###; Meng et al., 2023  ###reference_b14###; Nanda et al., 2023  ###reference_b17###). Some of these works (Nanda et al., 2023  ###reference_b17###; Li et al., 2023  ###reference_b13###; Zhong et al., 2023  ###reference_b29###) practice mechanistic interpretability by studying models trained on synthetic worlds. We apply some mechanistic interpretability techniques in a synthetic setting to study the problem of whether language models \u201cthink ahead\u201d for future tokens."

        "research_background": "###Motivation:\nThe motivation behind this paper stems from a fundamental question in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence: Do language models, like humans, plan for future tokens when generating language? This inquiry builds upon decades of linguistic research showing that humans predict upcoming language input and think multiple steps ahead while speaking. Contrastingly, contemporary language models process each token with a fixed amount of information without a clear indication of similar forward-planning. Understanding whether and how language models anticipate future tokens can provide insights into their efficacy and potential improvements in their design and training.\n\n###Research Problem:\nThe core research problem addressed in the paper is to determine whether language models exhibit anticipation of future tokens\u2014akin to human predictive language processing\u2014and if they do, to understand the mechanisms behind this behavior. Specifically, the paper investigates whether language models precompute information relevant for future tokens (pre-caching) or if the features computed for the current token incidentally aid future token prediction (breadcrumbs hypothesis). This involves examining whether language models allocate computational resources towards optimizing immediate token prediction or distributing them for future token predictions, and the implications of such mechanisms on the model\u2019s performance and training dynamics.\n\n###Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **Human Predictive Language Processing:**\n   - Huettig (2015) and Miller (1951) provide foundational insights into how humans predict upcoming language elements during communication.\n   - Barthel et al. (2016) demonstrated that humans internally anticipate words and sentences ahead of time.\n\n2. **Contemporary Language Model Mechanics:**\n   - Vaswani et al. (2017) described the transformer architecture that processes each token with a fixed amount of information, pivotal for understanding current language model structures.\n\n3. **Predictive Abilities of Language Models:**\n   - Pal et al. (2023), Hernandez et al. (2024), and Cai et al. (2024) showed that it is possible to predict future tokens by probing the hidden states of language models and that interventions on these hidden states can predictably alter future outputs. These findings suggest a level of future token predictability in model activations but do not clarify whether this is due to intentional forward-planning or incidental data properties.\n\nThe paper leverages these prior works to frame its investigation, seeking to disentangle whether language models deliberately plan for future tokens or if apparent predictive capabilities are a byproduct of their training and data characteristics.",
        "methodology": "The methodology section outlines a study investigating whether language models anticipate future tokens during the inference phase. Specifically, the study focuses on a generic causal sequence-to-sequence prediction task, where data is distributed according to some domains. The core task is to estimate the conditional expectations \\(\\mathbb{E}[y | x_{<t}]\\) for \\(t\\in\\{1, 2, \\ldots, T\\}\\). For classification problems, this translates to estimating conditional probabilities \\(P(y_t | x_{<t})\\) for each class \\(y_t\\), with \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) being the probability simplex over all classes. For an autoregressive setup, \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is the space of possible token sequences and \\(\\mathbb{Y}_t\\) corresponds to individual tokens.\n\nIn prior observations, especially noted by Pal et al., transformer models are shown to store information in hidden states during the inference process at one position \\(t\\), which is then useful for future inferences at subsequent positions \\(t'\\). The loss function at each timestep \\(t\\) assesses the model based on its performance in predicting \\(y_t\\), making it unclear how models develop the capacity for future token preparation.\n\nTwo explanations are proposed to clarify this phenomenon:\n1. **Pre-caching**: The model deliberately computes and stores features expected to be useful in future inferences, even if they don't impact the immediate prediction task.\n2. **Breadcrumbs**: Features that optimize the current inference task naturally turn out to be useful for future predictions. The traces left unintentionally during the current inference are utilized in subsequent steps.\n\nTo distinguish between these two explanations, the study introduces \"myopic transformer models.\" These models are defined to be incapable of deliberate pre-caching. Therefore, the advantage of past features for future tasks in myopic models must arise purely from breadcrumbs. The study leverages the gap in performance between standard (vanilla) transformer models and myopic transformer models to quantitatively measure the extent of pre-caching.",

The motivation for including Bernoulli variables \\( u_i \\) is to explore how models handle decreasing \\(\\delta\\), which changes the expected first time when \\( u_i \\) becomes useful. In scenarios where \\(\\delta\\) is sufficiently small, the probability \\( 1 - \\delta^k \\) that \\( u_i \\) is never useful becomes significant. The experiment aims to show that the transformer model learns to pre-cache under these conditions.\n\n**Baselines:**\nA myopic model (lacking off-diagonal gradient terms and thus incapable of pre-caching \\( u_i \\) at position \\( i \\)) is employed as a baseline. One possible strategy for this myopic model is outlined in Algorithm 2, which contrasts with another strategy (Algorithm 1) capable of utilizing pre-caching.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\nEvaluation focuses on comparing the performance of the transformers trained with and without pre-caching capabilities. The key performance metric is error rate, specifically assessed to observe if the model leveraging pre-caching (Algorithm 1) performs better than the brute force approach (Algorithm 2) that doesn\u2019t use pre-caching, especially given the same parameter count.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\nThe results indicate that:\n- As \\(\\delta\\) decreases, the expected first time when \\( u_i \\) becomes useful advances further into the future.\n- When \\(\\delta\\) is sufficiently small, the probability that \\( u_i \\) is never useful becomes non-negligible.\n- Even under these conditions, the transformer model learns to pre-cache, demonstrating significant performance benefits over the myopic model which lacks the capability to pre-cache.\n- Specifically, Algorithm 1 shows that computing scalar nonlinear functions in each layer can outperform the brute force approach of Algorithm 2, which computes a high-dimensional nonlinear function within a single layer.\n\nThese results support the notion that transformers demonstrate significant pre-caching behavior, benefiting from it even in simplified synthetic scenarios."
