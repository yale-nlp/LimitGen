            "text": "###figure_1### Improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is one of the most important directions of current research.\nAs such, proper benchmarking of current LLM abilities is paramount for ensuring progress continues in the correct direction.\nCurrently, the field typically relies on public benchmarks such as GSM8k Cobbe et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###), MATH Hendrycks et al. (2021b  ###reference_b14###), MBPP Austin et al. (2021  ###reference_b2###), HumanEval Chen et al. (2021  ###reference_b8###), SWEBench Jimenez et al. (2024  ###reference_b18###)).\nHowever, because LLMs are trained on large corpora of data scraped from the Internet, there are major concerns that such benchmarks may inadvertently include examples that closely resemble the questions found in such benchmarks.\nThis contamination may result in models having weaker reasoning capabilities than otherwise believed, due to simply being able to repeat the correct answer that it previously encountered during pre- or post- training.\nTo properly investigate the reasoning abilities of models, we commission GSM1k, a newly constructed collection of 1250 grade school level math problems designed to mirror that of GSM8k.\nWe took extensive efforts to ensure that GSM1k had a similar distribution of difficulty to GSM8k to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison. These efforts are described in Section 3  ###reference_###, alongside a detailed description of the data creation process.\nTo mitigate worries about data contamination, we created GSM1k solely with human annotators, without assistance from any LLM or other synthetic data source.\nWe benchmark leading open-source and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, including GPT-4 OpenAI et al. (2024  ###reference_b20###), Gemini Team et al. (2024  ###reference_b27###), Claude, Mistral Jiang et al. (2024  ###reference_b17###, 2023  ###reference_b16###), Llama Touvron et al. (2023a  ###reference_b28###, b  ###reference_b29###), Phi Gunasekar et al. (2023  ###reference_b12###); Abdin et al. (2024  ###reference_b1###) and many more.\nOur analysis confirms that the widespread suspicion in the field that many models are contaminated by benchmark data, with the worst model performing 13% worse on GSM1k compared to GSM8k. Additionally, our results suggest that several families of models, most notably Mistral and Phi, show consistent evidence of overfitting for nearly all model versions and sizes.\nFurther analysis finds a positive relationship (Spearman\u2019s ) between a model\u2019s probability of generating examples from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, strongly suggesting that one important component of this overfitting is that models have partially memorized examples from GSM8k.\nNevertheless, our results find that all frontier models, as well as all sizes of the Llama2 family, show minimal signs of overfitting.\nAdditionally, we also find that all models, including the most overfit ones, are still capable of successfully generalizing to new mathematical grade school problems, albeit occasionally at lower rates than their benchmark numbers would suggest.\nWe do not intend to release GSM1k publicly at this time to prevent a similar problem of data contamination occurring in the future. However, we plan to run recurring evaluations of all major open- and closed- source releases and to continually update our results. We will also open source our entire evaluation code so that the public version of our results can be reproduced. Additionally, we commit to open sourcing the entire benchmark when either 1) the top open source models score over 95% on GSM1k or 2) at the end of 2025, whichever comes earlier. See Section 3  ###reference_### for precise criteria for release."

This work measured overfitting in ImageNet by creating new versions of CIFAR10 and ImageNet and measuring the performance gap between the public test set and the newly created sets they constructed. In this work, we do a similar analysis on GSM8k, one of the leading benchmarks for elementary mathematical reasoning.\nGSM1k is modelled primarily after the GSM8k dataset Cobbe et al.

Each problem is designed to be solvable using only basic arithmetic operations (, , , ) with a difficulty level appropriate for grade school students.\nAs of April 2024, top models report benchmark accuracies of over 95% Team et al.

(2024  ###reference_b26###) propose functional evaluations, where benchmarks are written in the form of functions that can generate an infinite number of specific evaluation datapoints, each with slightly different numbers.\nIn this setup, whenever a language model is evaluated, functional evaluations generate a specific problem instance to evaluate the model on, which is then never used again.\nThis reduces the worry of data contamination by ensuring that no datapoint is ever used twice.\nLike ours, their results indicate the LLMs may be severely overfit on benchmark data.\nThe main advantage of our approach over a purely function based evaluation is that functional evaluations can only generate a tiny portion of the full problem space by producing variations of the same problem with slightly different numerical values. Their results also suggest substantial amounts of data contamination, including for frontier models, in the MATH dataset."

The precise instructions and UI given to the annotators is available in Appendix A  ###reference_###.\nAll problem annotators were instructed to create problems solvable with only basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and which did not require any advanced math concepts. As is the case with GSM8k, all problem solutions are positive integers111GSM8k has a few problems, likely errors, for which this is not the case..\nNo language models were used in the process of constructing this dataset.\nTo prevent data contamination concerns with GSM1k, we will not be releasing the dataset publicly at this time.\nHowever, we commit to releasing the full GSM1k dataset when at least one of the two following conditions have passed, whichever comes earlier. 1) Three open-source models with different pre-trained foundational model lineages reach 95% accuracy on GSM1k. 2) The end of 2025.\nAt such a point, we believe that grade school mathematics will likely no longer be difficult enough to materially benchmark model releases and commit to releasing all data into the public domain under the MIT license.\nAdditionally, to evaluate proprietary models, we were required to send over the dataset via API. Our belief is that model providers typically do not use such datapoints for model training.\nNevertheless, in case GSM1k data is leaked through such means, we also hold out a small number of data points that have passed all quality checks but do not appear in the final GSM1k dataset.\nThis data will also be released alongside GSM1k upon final release.\nWe encourage future benchmarks to follow a similar pattern, where they are not released publicly lest they be gamed, but are precommitted to be released at a future date or upon a future condition.\nAs part of this release, we will also open source our evaluation framework, which is based off of a fork of the LM Evaluation Harness by EleutherAI Gao et al.

We would recommend reading all results with the understanding that GSM8k and GSM1k are only highly similar, but not identically distributed despite all our efforts below."

To construct problems of difficulty , we requested annotators to construct problems with  required resolution steps and prompted them with 3 examples from GSM8k with estimated difficulty . The distribution of problems requested from annotators matched the estimated distribution in GSM8k.\nDifficulty is tricky to measure precisely, so we used an estimate based on the number of operations needed to solve the problem. This was extracted programmatically by counting the number of \u201ccalculator\u201d tags in the problem solution. However, as not all problem solutions were formatted consistently, this estimate is only a rough estimate of actual difficulty. Additionally, the number of resolution steps in a problem does not necessarily directly correlate with the true level of problem difficulty.\nPast work has also found that LLMs struggle with problems with larger numbers Gao et al. (2023b  ###reference_b11###) even if they can solve otherwise identical problems with smaller numbers. To remove this as a potential confounding variable, our final processing step is to discard candidate problems from GSM1k so that the answer magnitude distributions of GSM8k and GSM1k are as similar as possible. This selection process is described in Figure 4  ###reference_###. GSM1k consists of the 1250 problems that survive this final winnowing.\n###figure_3### Additionally, we run several checks to ensure that our efforts to match benchmark difficulty were successful."

Separately, we also tested several paper authors who had not yet seen the data and they were also unable to perform much better than random.

We repeated this exact setup for GSM1k. Annotators were able to solve an average of  problems on the GSM8k dataset. They were able to solve  problems on the GSM1k dataset, where the error rates are the standard deviations of the evaluation.

We extract the last numeric answer in the response and compare this to the correct answer. As such, model responses which produce the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer in a format that do not match the examples are marked as incorrect. For open source models, we use vLLM to speed up model inference if a model is compatible with the library. Otherwise, we default to inference using standard HuggingFace libraries. Closed-source models were queried through the LiteLLM library which unifies the API call format for all proprietary models evaluated. All API model results were from queries between April 16 - April 28, 2024 and use the default settings.\nAs model benchmark performance is highly dependent on choice of prompt and evaluation setting, our reported GSM8k numbers may occasionally be below the reported model benchmark numbers, as we use a standardized setting for all models instead of the prompt that maximizes each individual model\u2019s performance. For completeness, we also report results with an alternative prompting format uses non-GSM8k examples as n-shot examples in Appendix C  ###reference_###.\nNevertheless, since we focus primarily on the difference between a model\u2019s performance on GSM1k and GSM8k when holding fixed an evaluation strategy, we believe the above setup to be a fair comparison for all models.\nWe will release the full evaluation code for reproducibility.\n###figure_6### We select models to evaluate based on popularity. Additionally, we evaluated several lesser known models that sit near the top of the OpenLLMLeaderboard and discover evidence of Goodhart\u2019s law: many of these models perform substantially worse on GSM1k, suggesting that they are primarily gaming the GSM8k benchmark rather than improving model reasoning capabilities. The full set of results, including the performance table for all models, can be found in Appendix D  ###reference_###.

In particular, we find that all frontier or close-to-frontier models (including the proprietary Mistral Large) appear to perform similarly on both GSM8k and GSM1k. We posit two potential hypotheses for this: 1) frontier models have sufficiently advanced reasoning capability so that they can generalize to new problems even if they have already seen GSM8k problems in their training set, 2) frontier model builders may be more careful about data contamination.\nWhile it is impossible to know for certain without looking at the training set for each model, one piece of evidence in favor of the former is that Mistral Large is the only model in the Mistral family to show no signs of overfitting. Since the hypothesis that Mistral took unique care in ensuring only that their largest model was free from data contamination seems unlikely, we lean instead towards the hypothesis that sufficiently strong LLMs also learn elementary reasoning ability during training. If a model learns strong enough reasoning capabilities to solve problems of a given difficulty, it will be able to generalize to new problems even if GSM8k has appeared in their training set."

Our results do not support this conjecture. The fact that a model is overfit does not mean that it is poor at reasoning, merely that it is not as good as the benchmarks might indicate it to be. In fact, we find that many of the most overfit models are still capable of reasoning and solving novel problems. For example, while Phi-3 has an almost 10% drop in accuracy between GSM8k and GSM1k, we find that it is still able to correctly solve over 68% of GSM1k problems \u2013 which are certain to not have appeared in its training distribution. This performance is similar to that of much larger models such as dbrx-instruct, which contains almost 35x as many parameters. Similarly, Mistral models remain some of the strongest open source models, even accounting for their overfitting. This provides additional evidence for our lesson that sufficiently strong models learn elementary reasoning, even if benchmark data accidentally leaked into the training distribution, as is likely to be the case for the most overfit models."

            "text": "A priori, a natural hypothesis is that the primary cause for overfitting is data contamination, e.g. that the test set was leaked in the pre-training or instruction fine-tuning part of the model creation.\nPrevious work has suggested that models put higher log-likelihoods on data that they have seen during training Carlini et al. (2023  ###reference_b7###). We test the hypothesis that data contamination is the cause of overfitting by measuring a model\u2019s probability of generating an example from the GSM8k test set and compare it to how overfit it is on GSM8k compared to GSM1k, using the assumption that a model\u2019s probability of generating the GSM8k test set is a proxy for whether the sequence is likely to have appeared in the training set. We normalize by , the number of characters in the sequence, to make the log-likelihood calculations comparable between sequences and models with different tokenizers. Formally, we have:\nwith  being the number of characters in the sequence.\nFigure 8  ###reference_### shows the result of this plot against the gap between GSM8k and GSM1k performance.\nWe indeed find a positive relationship between the two values. We observe a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation of 0.32 between the per-character log-likelihood of generating GSM8k and the performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k , and the relationship suggests that every percentage point difference in GSM8k and GSM1k performance is associated with an increase of  in the per-character log-likelihood. This result suggests that some of the reason for overfitting is due to partial memorization of the test set. For completeness, we also report the standard Pearson  and the Kendall\u2019s  of 0.28, but note that Pearson  is not the ideal metric due to the curve-of-best-fit not appearing linear.\nNevertheless, data contamination is likely not the full story. We observe this via the presence of several outliers, which cause the  value to be relatively low. Examining these outliers carefully reveals that the model with the lowest per-character log-likelihood (Mixtral-8x22b) and the model with the highest per-character log-likelihood (Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct) are not only variations of the same model, but also have similar levels of overfit Jiang et al. (2024  ###reference_b17###). Perhaps more intriguingly, the most overfit model we discovered (Math-Shepherd-Mistral-7B-RL Yu et al. (2023  ###reference_b31###)) had a relatively low per-character log-likelihood. Math Shepherd trains a reward model on process level data using synthetic data. As such, we hypothesize that the reward modelling process may have leaked information about the correct reasoning chains for GSM8k even if the problems themselves did not ever appear in the dataset. Finally, we observe that the Llema models Azerbayev et al. (2024  ###reference_b3###) have both high log-likelihoods and minimal overfit. These models are open-sourced alongside their training data, and the authors report finding a very small number of GSM8k examples in the training corpus. Nevertheless, they also find (and our study supports) that these few instances do not lead to overfitting. The existence of these outliers suggests that overfitting on GSM8k is not purely due to data contamination, but rather may be through other indirect means, such as model builders collecting data similar in nature to benchmarks as training data or selecting final model checkpoints based on performance on benchmarks, even if the model itself may have not seen the GSM8k dataset at any point via training. Conversely, the reverse is also true: small amounts of data contamination do not necessarily lead to overfitting."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe motivation of this paper is based on the critical importance of improving and accurately assessing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The paper expresses concern over the current practice of relying heavily on public benchmarks to gauge the performance of LLMs. These datasets, such as GSM8k and others, may contain examples that the models have already encountered during their training, leading to potential data contamination. This contamination can give an inflated view of a model's reasoning abilities, as it might be simply recalling pre-seen answers rather than genuinely solving problems.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe research problem addressed by this paper is the potential overfitting of LLMs due to data contamination in widely-used benchmarks. To assess the true reasoning abilities of LLMs, the paper introduces GSM1k, a new benchmark specifically designed to eliminate the risk of data contamination by ensuring none of the problems are derived from or influenced by data available to the models during their training. This new benchmark also aims to ensure that its difficulty is comparable to existing benchmarks to facilitate fair and accurate comparisons.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\nThe paper mentions several relevant benchmarks and studies that have been prominent in the assessment of LLM capabilities:\n1. **GSM8k** by Cobbe et al. (2021) - A benchmark often used for grade school level math problems.\n2. **MATH** by Hendrycks et al. (2021) - Another pertinent benchmark for mathematical problem-solving.\n3. **MBPP** by Austin et al. (2021) - A benchmark intended for evaluating model performance in programming and problem-solving.\n4. **HumanEval** by Chen et al. (2021) - A benchmark to evaluate language models' capabilities in code generation.\n5. **SWEBench** by Jimenez et al. (2024) - A benchmark designed for evaluating software engineering related tasks.\n\nThese studies and benchmarks provide the foundation on which current LLM performances are evaluated, highlighting the existing constraints related to potential data contamination. The new benchmark, GSM1k, aims to address these limitations by providing a dataset created without LLM assistance and devoid of contamination, ensuring a more accurate evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology: A Careful Examination of Large Language Model Performance on Grade School Arithmetic\n\n#### GSM1k Dataset Creation\n- **Composition**: GSM1k comprises 1250 problems aimed at testing elementary mathematical reasoning.\n- **Human Annotators**: Problems were generated by human annotators sourced from Scale AI. These annotators were presented with 3 example problems from GSM8k and tasked with creating new problems of a similar difficulty.\n- **Instructions**: Annotators were guided to create problems solvable using only basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and which avoided advanced mathematical concepts. Problems were required to have solutions that are positive integers.\n- **Data Integrity**: The process ensured no language models were involved in dataset construction to maintain problem originality and prevent potential biases.\n\n#### Data Release Plan\n- **Non-Public Release**: GSM1k is not being released publicly at this time to prevent data contamination.\n- **Future Commitments**: The dataset will be publicly released under two conditions: \n  1. When three open-source models with different pre-trained foundational model lineages achieve 95% accuracy on GSM1k.\n  2. By the end of 2025.\n- **Rationale**: The delay in public release is intended to ensure that by then, grade school mathematics will likely no longer be a challenging benchmark for new model releases.\n\n#### Evaluation and API Usage\n- **Proprietary Model Evaluation**: Evaluations required sending the dataset via API to model providers, who typically do not use these data points for training.\n- **Holdout Data**: A small subset of data points, which have passed quality checks but are not included in GSM1k, is reserved and will be released alongside the main dataset to guard against potential data leaks.\n\n#### Evaluation Framework\n- **Open Sourcing**: The evaluation framework used will be open sourced, based on a modified version of the LM Evaluation Harness by EleutherAI.\n\n#### Considerations and Recommendations\n- **Similarity to GSM8k**: Efforts were made to ensure GSM1k is highly similar to GSM8k, though there will be minor differences due to inherent challenges in exactly duplicating the test set environment.\n- **Future Benchmarks**: It is recommended that future benchmark datasets follow a similar release pattern to prevent gaming and to ensure robustness and reliability of model evaluations.\n\n### Innovations and Key Components\n1. **Human-Annotated Dataset**: Authentically generated problems by human annotators to ensure quality and relevance.\n2. **Strategic Data Release Plan**: A balanced approach between ensuring data integrity and future availability based on performance milestones or time-based conditions.\n3. **Holdout Data for Validation**: An additional layer to protect against potential data leaks and maintain the credibility of benchmarks.\n4. **Open Sourced Evaluation Framework**: Commitment to transparency and reproducibility in model evaluation.\n5. **Model Evaluations via API**: Facilitates evaluations while aiming to prevent proprietary misuse of the dataset.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\n**Datasets:**\n- **GSM8k**: A dataset of grade school math problems used for training and evaluation.\n- **GSM1k**: Another dataset of grade school math problems used for performance comparison.\n\nBoth datasets are used with the same prompt consisting of 5 randomly drawn examples from the GSM8k train set.\n\n**Evaluation Harness:**\n- **EleutherAI\u2019s LM Evaluation Harness**: Forked version with default settings to maintain consistency.\n- **Temperature Setting**: Evaluations for all open-source models are conducted at temperature 0 to ensure reproducibility. Closed-source models are evaluated using the LiteLLM library.\n\n**Inference Libraries:**\n- **vLLM**: Used for speedup in model inference for compatible open-source models.\n- **HuggingFace Libraries**: Default inference method when vLLM is not applicable.\n- **LiteLLM**: Used for querying closed-source models through a unified API format.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\n- **Answer Extraction**: The last numeric answer in the response is extracted and compared with the correct answer. Correct answers in non-matching formats are marked as incorrect.\n- **API Query Period**: Closed-source model results were acquired between April 16 - April 28, 2024, using default settings.\n\n**Prompting Format:**\n- A standardized prompt for all models, which may result in lower performance compared to model-specific optimized prompts. An alternative prompting format using non-GSM8k examples is detailed in Appendix C.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n\n1. **Performance Dependency on Prompt and Evaluation Setting**:\n   - Acknowledges occasional discrepancy between reported GSM8k numbers and actual model performance due to standardized evaluation settings.\n\n2. **Fair Comparison Across Models**:\n   - Focuses on performance differences between GSM1k and GSM8k while holding the evaluation strategy constant, ensuring a fair comparison.\n\n3. **Model Selection and Benchmarking**:\n   - Popular models and lesser-known models near the top of the OpenLLMLeaderboard were evaluated.\n   - Evidence of Goodhart\u2019s law observed, where some models perform significantly worse on GSM1k, indicating potential overfitting to GSM8k rather than genuine improvement in reasoning abilities.\n\n4. **Result Presentation**:\n   - Full performance tables and results are detailed in Appendix D, with models compared based on similar performance bands on GSM8k.\n\n**Key Insight**:\n- The experiment highlights the importance of consistent evaluation settings to ensure fair benchmarking and exposes potential shortcomings in models that appear to be gaming specific benchmarks rather than advancing general capabilities."
