    "abstract": "Whisper is a multitask and multilingual speech model covering 99 languages. It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we examine its limitations, demonstrating the presence of speaker-related (gender, age) and model-related (resourcefulness and model size) bias. Despite that, we show that only model-related bias are amplified by quantization, impacting more low-resource languages and smaller models. Searching for a better compression approach, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach that is able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.",

            "text": "Over the past three years, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been revolutionized by the introduction of large pre-trained models, often referred to as \"foundation models.\" These models, both for text and speech, are trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data and can subsequently be fine-tuned for specific tasks using limited labeled data.\n\nMultilingual foundation models have garnered significant attention due to their ability to handle hundreds of languages within a single model. However, they face a challenge known as the curse of multilinguality: in order to maintain high performance across all supported languages, these models require an increase in the number of parameters, leading to larger memory requirements and slower inference times. This can render the use of such models impractical in certain scenarios. To address this issue, research has been conducted on model compression techniques, although these methods may inadvertently exacerbate biases present in the model.\n\nThis internship focuses on OpenAI\u2019s Whisper, a family of multilingual multi-task speech models known for their impressive performance in speech recognition. These models exhibit robustness when transcribing speech recorded under various conditions, surpassing the capabilities of previous models.\n\nHowever, there remain important questions to explore regarding Whisper and its multi-task learning approach. Although the model presents exceptional capability for transcribing and translating English, its performance in other languages indicates a decline in multilingual capabilities as the model size decreases. Additionally, we aim to investigate how this multilingual architecture handles biases related to different speakers, including gender, age, and accent. These questions drive our research to enhance the understanding of Whisper\u2019s capabilities and limitations."

            "text": "Current ASR approaches primarily involve adapting pre-trained Transformer stacks (vaswani2017attention), which are initially trained through self-supervised learning (SSL) on unlabeled audio data. These pre-trained models can vary in their use of pre-text tasks (e.g., wav2vec 2.0 (baevski2020wav2vec), HuBERT (hsu2021hubert), WavLM (chen2022wavlm)) and the range of languages they cover (e.g., XLSR-53 (conneau21_interspeech), XLS-R (babu22_interspeech), MMS (pratap2023scaling), Google-USM (zhang2023google)). This development of models has also seen the introduction of monolingual and multilingual SSL benchmarks. Examples of such benchmarks include SUPERB for English (yang21c_interspeech), LeBenchmark (evain2021task) for French, and ML-SUPERB (shi2023ml), which covers 143 languages. In contrast to this line of research, the Whisper model relies on weak supervision, meaning it is trained solely on weakly labeled data (without self-supervision). Nevertheless, with an ample amount of data, the Whisper model achieves competitive results when compared to monolingual (radford2023robust) and multilingual (pratap2023scaling) SSL models. More details about Whisper can be found on Section 2.6."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\n\nThe motivation for this paper stems from the evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the development and implementation of large pre-trained models, also known as \"foundation models.\" These models, which can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with minimal labeled data, have significantly improved NLP performances in both text and speech processing. The emergence of multilingual foundation models, which can manage hundreds of languages within a single framework, highlights a pivotal innovation. However, these models face the \"curse of multilinguality,\" where maintaining high performance across multiple languages necessitates increasing the number of parameters, thereby resulting in larger memory requirements and slower inference times. This can cause practical limitations in certain applications. An additional complexity arises from existing model compression techniques which, while addressing some challenges, may inadvertently increase biases present in the models.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe core research problem this paper addresses revolves around OpenAI\u2019s Whisper: a family of multilingual, multi-task speech models renowned for their superior speech recognition performance. The paper seeks to tackle several critical questions regarding Whisper's multi-task learning approach:\n1. The deterioration of performance in non-English languages as the model size decreases.\n2. The model\u2019s treatment of biases, specifically those related to speaker attributes such as gender, age, and accent.\n\nThe aim is to enhance understanding of Whisper\u2019s capabilities and limitations in handling these challenges.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\n- **Foundation Models**: The introduction and advancement of large pre-trained models have revolutionized NLP. These models utilize vast amounts of unlabeled data and undergo fine-tuning processes for specific tasks, showing remarkable versatility and efficiency.\n- **Multilingual Models**: The development of multilingual foundation models that support numerous languages has been a key focus. Yet, these models suffer from the curse of multilinguality, which demands increased parameters to sustain performance across languages.\n- **Model Compression Techniques**: Techniques designed to reduce model size and resource demands have been developed. However, these techniques might inadvertently exacerbate existing biases in the models.\n- **Whisper Models**: OpenAI's Whisper models have set a new benchmark in speech recognition by demonstrating robustness across different recording conditions. While these models excel in transcribing and translating English, their performance in other languages declines as model size decreases.\n\nBy delving into these aspects, the paper builds on previous research to address and possibly mitigate the identified issues within Whisper\u2019s framework.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology:\n\nWe extend the **Conditional Language-Specific Routing (CLSR) modules**, initially proposed by Zhang et al. (2021) for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation, to the speech domain for the first time. This module introduces sparsity to the Transformer architecture by learning a hard binary gate for each input token through its hidden embedding. These gates enable a layer to selectively guide information through either a Language-Specific (LS) path or a shared path.\n\n**Key Components and Modifications:**\n\n1. **Language-Specific Gates:**\n   - Unlike the original CLSR, which shares gates across languages, our method employs language-specific gates.\n   - This modification allows the training of language-specific components individually and in parallel.\n   - At inference, only the relevant language-specific modules are loaded, making the process more efficient.\n\n2. **Positioning in Transformer Architecture:**\n   - Following guidance from previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2022), we integrate CLSR exclusively into the feed-forward network component of the Transformer.\n   - We replace the entire feed-forward network with the CLSR module, which reduces the number of additional parameters required.\n\n3. **Gate Construction:**\n   - Each gate is formed by a two-layer bottleneck network.\n   - Noise is added during training to help discretize the gate values. The process involves increasing zero-mean Gaussian noise.\n   - The logistic-sigmoid function is used, with \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) as trainable parameters.\n   - The noise \\(\\epsilon\\) is linearly increased along with training steps \\(t\\).\n\n**Equations for Calculation:**\n\nDuring training:\n\\[ g = \\sigma(\\alpha \\cdot h + \\beta + \\epsilon) \\]\nwhere \\( \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2(t)) \\)\n\nAt inference:\n\\[ g = \\delta(\\alpha \\cdot h + \\beta) \\]\nwhere \\( \\delta \\) represents the Dirac measure.\n\nThese gates' precise determination aids in the variable routing of information, either through language-specific paths or shared paths, depending on the gate's value.",
