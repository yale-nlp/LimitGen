    "title": "Red Teaming Language Models for Contradictory Dialogues",
    "abstract": "Most language models currently available are prone to self-contradiction during dialogues. To mitigate this issue, this study explores a novel contradictory dialogue processing task that aims to detect and modify contradictory statements in a conversation. This task is inspired by research on context faithfulness and dialogue comprehension, which have demonstrated that the detection and understanding of contradictions often necessitate detailed explanations. We develop a dataset comprising contradictory dialogues, in which one side of the conversation contradicts itself. Each dialogue is accompanied by an explanatory label that highlights the location and details of the contradiction. With this dataset, we present a Red Teaming framework for contradictory dialogue processing. The framework detects and attempts to explain the dialogue, then modifies the existing contradictory content using the explanation. Our experiments demonstrate that the framework improves the ability to detect contradictory dialogues and provides valid explanations. Additionally, it showcases distinct capabilities for modifying such dialogues. Our study highlights the importance of the logical inconsistency problem in conversational AI.",

            "text": "Dialogue systems have made significant advancements in recent years, propelled by the rapid development of language modeling and learning technologies. The focus on understanding and analyzing conversations between humans and machines has become paramount in this field, serving as a vital component in the development of intelligent interaction systems. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has played a substantial role in shaping dialogue-related research. These models have showcased impressive abilities in comprehending sophisticated context and generating fluent dialogue responses, and exhibit an exceptional level of control by performing summarization, explanation, enquiries, and role-playing within dialogues. However, semantic conflicts in the dialogue, such as contradictions and factual errors, pose challenges for language models (LMs) in recognizing and resolving them, resulting in significantly declined experience of human-machine interaction. According to logical studies, a contradiction refers to a situation where two or more statements cannot be simultaneously true. These discrepancies are primarily instigated by machines rather than humans, and even the LLM sometimes fails to provide satisfactory responses. This is demonstrated by the model\u2019s fluctuating attitudes and inconsistent faithfulness to the same issue throughout the dialogue. This inconsistency between utterances loses the anthropomorphic essence of human-computer conversation. Similarly, if a conversational participant conveys inconsistent intents or thoughts, they can also cause confusion in dialogue understanding. This type of controversy, observed for a single protagonist and reflected as factual conflicts or changes in attitude, is known as self-contradiction. Contradiction is a key factor in enhancing comprehension of text and has been extensively studied in text generation, hallucination detection, and logical reasoning but rarely for dialogues.\n\nTo better study contradictory situations in the conversation, the first contribution of this paper is to propose a new dialogue processing task for addressing conversational contradiction. Dialogue-related tasks are aimed at generating utterances that satisfy human needs to communicate effectively. If contradiction arises in a dialogue, mostly self-contradiction, there must be at least two utterances whose semantics conflict. Improvement requires two efforts: detecting contradictory utterances and modifying them accordingly. Inspired by recent work on processing hallucinations, our work utilizes LLMs to detect and modify potential contradictions in dialogues. Furthermore, the contradiction detection subtask supports two more aspects: contradiction existence and explanation assessment.\n\nWhile the task poses a non-trivial dialogue processing problem to individual LMs, we envision that a proper solution can be revealed through the collaborative effort between multiple LMs. As our third contribution, we propose a Red Teaming framework where, in addition to the main dialogue model, there is another analyzer LM which collectively detects and explains contradictions. Since LLMs have strong language generation capabilities but can be overly confident about their generation, as an underlying motivation for this task, we find that a Red Teaming framework can be applied to utilize rationales from the fine-tuned analyzer LM to revise the contradiction within conversation. This will enhance LLMs\u2019 capability of optimizing for contradictory issues in the dialogue.\n\nThe proposed framework first fine-tunes the original LLM to improve the model\u2019s awareness and ability to detect conflicts. To ensure a full understanding of the contradiction in the dialogue, the model is required to provide formatted statements. Beyond detecting conflicts in dialogues, the Red Teaming LM also explains the conflicts and requests corrections based on the statements. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed Red Teaming framework proves to significantly enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of multiple series LLMs in detecting dialogue contradictions. Specifically, it outperforms a strong baseline model by two-fold on metrics of detection accuracy and explanation validity. We also demonstrate its ability to correct logical inconsistencies."

Considering the detection by LMs, the expected output is a binary label  indicating whether dialogue  contains at least one contradiction or not.  will be represented as a generated text label, such as either  or , which semantically correspond to contradictory label and non-contradictory label, respectively.\n\nFor the modification subtask, upon detecting a contradiction, LMs are required to revise the contradictory utterances to achieve that no logical inconsistency exists between any two sentences in the dialogue . For the case where  contradicts , which is typically a self-contradiction generated by the machine, either  or both  can be modified. There are two modification strategies: 1) Direct Edit, which involves modifying either  or  where the contradiction occurs, and 2) Joint Edit, which involves modifying both  and  simultaneously to resolve the contradiction."

Considering the difficulty of manually writing contradictory dialogues and data scarcity, inspired by Wei et al. (2022  ###reference_b60###) and Ouyang et al. (2022  ###reference_b45###), we chose to generate contradictory dialogues data in the form of conversation with ChatGPT. This was done with the following considerations. First, with guidance from instruction prompts and concrete examples, ChatGPT can provide data in the desired format and comprehensively cover the aforementioned topics, which significantly reduces both the cost and bias of human authoring. Second, our tests have shown that ChatGPT achieves human-like excellence in both contradiction detection and interpretation, whereas other open-source testable LLMs do not achieve similar levels of performance. Third, ChatGPT has the ability to generate high-quality contradiction explanations. More details on the quality of generation are shown in Section A.1  ###reference_###. For the quality assessment of the dataset, we randomly sampled 100 generated contradictory dialogues and selected two additional human annotators to measure their kappa scores, and the kappa agreement of this part of the data is 0.71 on the assessment of contradictory text quality. By constantly guiding ChatGPT to generate appropriate contradictory dialogues and explanations by modifying prompts, and repeating these steps after validation, the entire dataset construction process is shown in Figure 2  ###reference_###, inspired by Kim et al. (2022  ###reference_b27###).\n\n###figure_3### Statistics\nThe dataset constitutes 12,387 dialogues in total, which includes both contradictory and non-contradictory ones about similar sets of topics. For contradictory dialogues, we have collected 6,130 of those and each is accompanied by an explanation. Each dialogue averages 46.5 words across 4 sentences, with each sentence containing 11.6 words on average. The explanation accompanying each dialog contains on average 16.7 words. We selected 15 different daily topics from Wikipedia with reference to the Wizard of Wikipedia Dinan et al. (2019  ###reference_b12###) topics, and their distribution is illustrated in Figure 3  ###reference_###(a). We also extracted non-contradictory dialogues from the aforementioned public dataset, with a comparable number of contradictory dialogues and similar length, to facilitate categorization and evaluation.444All contradictory conversations have been manually reviewed and labeled. These datasets were combined and then separated into a training and a test sets, which included both contradictory and non-contradictory dialogues, as depicted in Figure 3  ###reference_###(b). The training set comprises 4,839 contradictory dialogues and 4,820 non-contradictory dialogues, while 1,291 contradictory as well as 1,437 non-contradictory dialogues are included in the test set, respectively."

There main advantage of using autoregressive LMs for contradiction detection compared to previous masked LM variants Nie et al. (2021  ###reference_b44###); Li et al. (2022  ###reference_b30###) lies in the fact that autoregressive LMs naturally suit the objective of generating explanation for the problematic context. This explanation enables us to identify responses from the model that capture contradictory intentions.\nTo instantiate aLMs, we first use zero-shot and few-shot methods to evaluate the contradiction detection capabilities of distinct models. The prompt  for the detection process comprises dialogue  and instruction , with the addition of two demo contradictory dialogues  to bootstrap for the few-shot scenario. We ask the LMs to determine if there are contradictions in dialogue  with the prompt  both in zero-shot and few-shot settings, as presented in the Section A.3  ###reference_###.\nIn the training stage, given the dialogue , we use instruction tuning to fine-tune the vanilla LM to generate the judgment label : .  is designated  or  to represent a judgment of contradiction. The instruction  is the same as the one in the zero-shot test. We conduct a randomly-tuned dataset of mixed contradictory and non-contradictory dialogues with disrupted topics for each LM to avoid the topic distribution effect on contradiction detection."

In addition, the discriminatory criteria used for the vanilla LMs are assessed by humans and described in Section A.2.\n\nResults Table 1 shows the results of contradictory dialogue detection. The vanilla LLaMA2 fails to exhibit the ability in detecting contradictions beyond smaller encoders like BERT and RoBERTa, even at the 13B model scale. Even the better-performing vanilla LLMs, like Vicuna and Mistral, did not attain convincing outcomes. A contributing factor to this lies in generative instability, for example, to generate the given dialogue in the answer. It is also partly due to deficiencies in the LMs\u2019 ability to judge contradictions and reasoning, which increases the occurrence of self-contradictions in dialogue. In contrast, fine-tuning aligns the LMs with the contradiction detection task. The vanilla Vicuna and LLaMA2\u2019s higher recall implies that these models are more inclined toward detecting contradictions in dialogues when judging them, aligning with our observations.

We evaluate both the vanilla and the fine-tuned versions of LMs as baselines for explanation generation. By manual evaluation only, we compare the LMs ranging from 7B to 13B.\n\nMetrics We conduct both automatic and human evaluations on the quality of explanations generated by various models. For automatic metrics, we use the labeled explanations in the dataset as reference and use the combined evaluation method in Section 3.2.2. Following the text similarity metrics used by Maynez et al. (2020) and Qin et al. (2022), we calculate with BERTScore Zhang et al. (2020) and BARTScore Yuan et al. (2021), respectively. To determine the value of , we sample 200 generated explanations, and human annotators evaluate them to mark whether the generated explanation could effectively explain the contradiction present in the dialogue, as shown in Figure 4. According to the figure, given , all points labeled as \"invalid\" by human annotators are excluded from = 0.65 region, we assume that this criterion approximately aligns with human requirements for validity. Thus we consider that as a discriminating value to determine the validity of the explanation and whether it is satisfactory or not. When , we calculate the percentage of explanations with , based on the computation in Equation 1, = 0.1. This metric is denoted as for convenience. Besides, we also measure the BLEU-4 Papineni et al. (2002) and ROUGE-L Lin (2004) of the generated results.\n\nFor human evaluation, we ask human judges to score explanations generated by each model for randomly chosen 200 test samples based on three criteria following Kim et al. (2022), i.e. label consistency, fluency, and completeness. Section B.2 provides detailed information on each criterion.\n\nResults While the individual models in Section 4.1 embody some contradiction detection capability, the percentage of their corresponding satisfactory explanations does not match the accuracy of contradiction detection, illustrating LLMs that identify contradictions do not necessarily explain them.\n\nAs shown in Table 2, the vanilla models exhibit varying explanatory abilities in response to the detected contradictory dialogue conditions. Specifically, at , LLaMA2-chat outperforms Vicuna and Mistral of the same size by 16.12% and 21.93%, respectively. The dialogue data alignment may have assisted in this performance. Meanwhile, the larger models demonstrate superior explanatory ability, with LLaMA2-13B-chat surpassing the 7B model by 10.65%. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of the four vanilla models still fall within the lower score range, for which we attribute to two reasons.\n\nFirst, when the vanilla models are able to explain contradictions, they also tend to generate additional task-irrelevant information. Second, when the vanilla models fail to explain contradictions, they generate contexts or dialogues containing contradictory utterances, resulting in higher scores by similar fragments. Regarding the fine-tuned models, the majority of the contradiction explanation scores fall within the higher score range, indicating a reduction in the generation of irrelevant information and an improvement in explaining. Additionally, a higher percentage of satisfactory explanations basically represents higher and between models, which also demonstrates the consistency of -embodied modeling capabilities.\n\nIn Table 3, LLaMA2-chat outperforms Mistral and Vicuna on all three human evaluation metrics. Uncontrolled token generation and duplicated output potentially contribute to the substandard performance of the vanilla LMs regarding fluency and completeness. Moreover, the label consistency of the three fine-tuned LMs correlates with the outcomes of the automatic evaluation in Table 2."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe paper is motivated by the need to enhance the human-machine interaction experience by addressing semantic conflicts, specifically contradictions, in dialogues generated by language models (LMs). Despite significant advancements in dialogue systems and large language models (LLMs), challenges persist in recognizing and resolving contradictions and factual errors, resulting in inconsistent and unsatisfactory user experiences. The paper seeks to address these issues to improve the quality and coherence of dialogues produced by LMs.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe research problem addressed in this paper is the identification and resolution of contradictions in dialogues generated by LLMs. The authors aim to propose a new dialogue processing task targeting conversational contradictions, which involves detecting inconsistent statements and modifying them to ensure coherence and logical consistency within dialogues. Additionally, they develop a dataset to support this task and introduce a Red Teaming framework to enhance the detection and correction of contradictions in dialogues.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Advancements in Dialogue Systems**: The paper builds on previous research highlighting significant advancements in dialogue systems and language modeling technologies (Ni et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2022).\n2. **Abilities of LLMs**: The emergence of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, has shown substantial capabilities in dialogue comprehension and generation (Chung et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a; Chiang et al., 2023). These models have been noted for their skills in summarization, explanation, enquiries, and role-playing within conversations (Luo et al., 2023; Hou et al., 2022; Khalifa et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023).\n3. **Challenges of Contradictions and Factual Errors**: The paper notes that semantic conflicts, including contradictions and factual errors, remain a challenge for LLMs (Nie et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Dziri et al., 2022; Daheim et al., 2023; Roller et al., 2021; Kandpal et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2023). Contradictions are a significant factor in the coherence of human-machine dialogues and have implications for text comprehension, generation, hallucination detection, and logical reasoning (de Marneffe et al., 2008; Welleck et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2020; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Agrawal et al., 2023; Magnini and Cabrio, 2010).\n4. **Logical Studies on Contradictions**: Logical studies define a contradiction as a situation where two or more statements cannot be simultaneously true (Dowden, 2017). Contradictions in dialogues often emanate from machine-generated texts rather than human contributions (Nass and Moon, 2000; Marcus, 2018).\n5. **Processing Hallucinations**: The approach for detecting and modifying contradictions in the paper is inspired by recent work on processing hallucinations in language models (M\u00fcndler et al., 2023).\n6. **Limitations of Current LLMs**: Existing LLMs often exhibit logical incompleteness and overconfidence in their responses (Wang et al., 2023; Sanyal et al., 2023; Creswell et al., 2023; Mielke et al., 2022; Kadavath et al., 2022).\n\nBy building upon these areas of prior research, the paper aims to innovate in the domain of dialogue coherence and logical consistency for LLM-generated conversations.",
        "methodology": "Red Teaming Language Models for Contradictory Dialogues\n**Methodology:** In this section, we outline the proposed Red Teaming method for resolving contradictory dialogues.\n\nThe primary objective of our Red Teaming methodology is to identify and correct contradictions within dialogues generated by language models. The method is built upon the following key components:\n\n1. **Dialogue Generation and Collection:** Starting with a language model, we generate a diverse set of dialogues. These dialogues cover various scenarios and contexts to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the model's propensity for producing contradictions.\n\n2. **Detection of Contradictions:** We employ a detection mechanism to locate contradictions within the generated dialogues. This mechanism leverages both rule-based approaches and neural networks trained specifically to identify conflicting statements within a sequence of dialogues.\n\n3. **Red Teaming Exercises:** Once contradictions are detected, we initiate Red Teaming exercises. Here, a team of annotators (the Red Team) meticulously reviews the contradictory dialogues to understand the nature and context of each contradiction. Their insights form the basis for the subsequent steps in the methodology.\n\n4. **Model Fine-tuning:** Based on the findings from the Red Teaming exercises, we fine-tune the language model. This step involves adjusting the model's parameters and retraining it using carefully curated datasets designed to minimize the occurrence of contradictions.\n\n5. **Iteration and Feedback Loop:** The updated model is then subjected to further rounds of dialogue generation, contradiction detection, and Red Teaming. This iterative process ensures continuous improvement of the model's performance in generating coherent and logically consistent dialogues.\n\n6. **Evaluation:** Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our Red Teaming methodology by comparing the incidence of contradictions in dialogues produced by the original model versus the fine-tuned model. Evaluation metrics include the frequency of contradictions, the severity of identified contradictions, and the overall coherence of the dialogues.\n\nBy systematically identifying and addressing contradictions in language model outputs, our Red Teaming method aims to enhance the reliability and usability of AI-driven dialogue systems.",
