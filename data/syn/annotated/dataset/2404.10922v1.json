    "abstract": "Recent advancements in language modeling have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of various natural language processing tasks. Despite their success in text-based tasks, applying LLMs to the speech domain remains limited and challenging. This paper presents BLOOMZMMS, a novel model that integrates a multilingual LLM with a multilingual speech encoder, aiming to harness the capabilities of LLMs for speech recognition and beyond. Utilizing a multi-instructional training approach, we demonstrate the transferability of linguistic knowledge from the text to the speech modality. Our experiments, conducted on 1900 hours of transcribed data from 139 languages, establish that a multilingual speech representation can be effectively learned and aligned with a multilingual LLM. While this learned representation initially shows limitations in task generalization, we address this issue by generating synthetic targets in a multi-instructional style. Our zero-shot evaluation results confirm the robustness of our approach across multiple tasks, including speech translation and multilingual spoken language understanding, thereby opening new avenues for applying LLMs in the speech domain.",

            "text": "Language modeling task involves predicting subsequent text tokens based on a context of preceding ones Jurafsky and Martin (2009). Training a language model (LM) requires only raw text samples, as portions of these samples function as their labels, facilitating a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach. The widespread availability of machine-readable text online, coupled with advancements in computational power, has led to the rise of large LMs (LLMs) in recent years. These LLMs not only generate highly fluent natural text but also encode higher-level knowledge within their parameters. This enables them to tackle natural language processing tasks like reading comprehension and machine translation based only on task specific instructions, without needing labeled data Radford et al. (2019).\n\nSSL has recently made significant strides in the speech domain Baevski et al. (2020). Most applications of SSL in speech employ an encoder that transforms raw speech signals into high-level representations, serving either as a fixed feature extractor Yang et al. (2021) or a tunable pretrained model for various downstream tasks Babu et al. (2021). Incorporating of SSL pretrained encoders into Encoder-Decoder speech recognition models has dramatically reduced the amount of labeled data required for effective training Chang et al. (2021). However, using SSL pretrained decoders in such models is relatively rare. In certain instances, SSL is part of a joint training process that seeks to learn a shared speech and text representation Chen et al. (2022). However, this approach often demands a large dataset and considerable computational resources.\n\nRecent work has begun to harness the powerful text generation capabilities of decoder-only LLMs by incorporating them as the decoder component of Encoder-Decoder speech processing models. Wu et al. (2023) adopt the LLaMA-7B LLM for speech translation to English by training a speech encoder from scratch using filter bank acoustic features, 14,000 hours of internal speech data in 14 languages, and outputs of internal translation system as synthetic targets. Outputs of speech encoder are aligned with the text token embedding space using CTC pretraining and downsampled by averaging of consecutive frames with the same CTC output label. Ling et al. (2023) adopt the GPT2 XL LLM for fully-formatted English speech recognition by training a speech encoder from scratch using filter bank acoustic features, and 75,000 hours of internal transcribed English speech data. CTC loss is applied to speech encoder outputs as a part of the main training process and speech representations are downsampled by removal of frames classified as CTC blank labels with a predefined threshold. Li et al. (2023) adopt the LLaMA-7B LLM for long-form English speech recognition by incorporating the HuBERT-Large SSL pretrained speech encoder and finetuning it on the LibriSpeech dataset containing 960 hours of transcribed English speech. Outputs of the speech encoder are downsampled by a convolutional module trained as a part of the main training process. Fathullah et al. (2023) adopt the LLaMA-7B LLM for speech recognition in 8 languages by training a speech encoder from scratch using filter bank acoustic features and the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset containing 50,000 hours of transcribed speech in the same 8 languages. Speech encoder is pretrained with CTC loss and its outputs are downsampled by simple discarding of every frames. Nachmani et al. (2023) combine an internal pretrained LLM with an internal pretrained speech encoder and finetune it on the automatically transcribed LibriLight dataset containing 60,000 hours of English speech. The training is performed with a combination of the speech transcription and speech continuation tasks. The resulting model is utilized for the spoken language answering task.\n\nMost of these studies rely on conventional filter bank features for speech encoding and do not incorporate an SSL pretrained speech encoder, necessitating a large amount of training data. Moreover, scant attention has been given to leveraging the linguistic knowledge stored in LLMs for tasks beyond mere transcription and for languages other than English.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose BLOOMZMMS, a model that fuses a multilingual LLM (BLOOMZ Muennighoff et al. (2023)) with a multilingual speech encoder (MMS Pratap et al. (2023)). We argue that multi-instructional training is crucial for transferring linguistic knowledge from the text to speech modality. Our experiments demonstrate that training on 1900 hours of transcribed data from 139 languages yields a multilingual speech representation compatible with a multilingual LLM in the context of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task. Although this representation does not generalize well to other tasks, we show that the issue can be mitigated by generating additional synthetic targets. Our zero-shot evaluations confirm this approach\u2019s effectiveness across various tasks, including Spoken Language Translation (SLT) and multilingual spoken Natural Language Inference"

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation\nThe motivation for this paper arises from the challenges faced in utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in speech-related tasks, especially in a multilingual context. While there have been significant advancements in SSL for speech, most models use conventional filter bank features, necessitating large datasets and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, many existing models primarily focus on English and simple transcription tasks, thereby not fully leveraging the linguistic knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) for various languages and more complex tasks. This paper aims to address these gaps by developing a method that effectively fuses a multilingual large language model with a multilingual speech encoder.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe research problem addressed by the paper is the effective training of a model that can understand multilingual speech and deploy the linguistic knowledge inherent in large multilingual LLMs across multiple languages and tasks. Specifically, there is a need to integrate a multilingual LLM with a multilingual speech encoder in a way that reduces the dependence on large datasets and extends the model's capability beyond mere transcription, allowing it to perform tasks such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Translation (SLT), and multilingual spoken Natural Language Inference (NLI).\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n- **SSL in Language Modeling and Speech:** Previous literature has shown that SSL can be successfully applied to language modeling (Radford et al., 2019) and speech (Baevski et al., 2020), with significant progress being made in reducing the need for labeled data in speech applications (Chang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021).\n- **Incorporation of LLMs in Speech Processing Models:** Recent studies have begun to use decoder-only LLMs for various speech processing tasks. For instance, Wu et al. (2023) employed the LLaMA-7B LLM for speech translation, while Ling et al. (2023) adopted the GPT2 XL LLM for speech recognition.\n- **Use of SSL pretrained Speech Encoders:** The rarity of employing SSL-pretrained decoders in speech models has been slightly addressed by researchers like Li et al. (2023) who used HuBERT-Large as a pretrained speech encoder for long-form English speech recognition.\n- **Multilingual Speech Models:** Fathullah et al. (2023) and Nachmani et al. (2023) have adopted multilingual approaches but still rely heavily on large datasets and specific language domains, primarily English.\n  \nThis body of work indicates the need to develop a more efficient method that can generalize well across multiple languages and tasks while utilizing the strengths of multilingual LLMs and SSL-pretrained speech encoders, which is what this paper aims to achieve with BLOOMZMMS.",
        "methodology": "**Methodology Overview:**\n\nThe proposed method aims to facilitate the understanding of multilingual speech by a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) through a multi-instructional training approach. The architecture and training process are as follows:\n\n### Model Components:\n\n1. **Pretrained Speech Encoder**: A model that processes speech recordings into an intermediate representation.\n2. **Adaptor Module**: A key component that maps the output of the speech encoder to the latent space of the text token embeddings of the LLM.\n3. **Large Language Model (LLM)**: A pre-trained language model which remains frozen during the training of the adaptor module.\n\n### Training Process:\n\nThe methodology focuses on training the Adaptor module using paired data consisting of speech recordings and their corresponding text transcriptions. The training process is divided into two main stages:\n\n1. **First Stage: CTC Loss Alignment**\n\n- **Projection and Logits Computation**: The output of the Adaptor  is projected to the LLM tokens\u2019 logits using the frozen output linear layer of the LLM.\n- **Minimizing CTC Loss**: The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss is minimized between the LLM token probabilities derived from these logits and the transcription.\n\n2. **Second Stage: Integrated Optimization**\n\n- **Concatenation with Prompts**: At this stage,  (output from Adaptor) is concatenated with the token embeddings of a text prompt prefix and postfix.\n- **Pass Through LLM**: This combined sequence is passed through the self-attention layers of the LLM.\n- **Cross-Entropy Loss Minimization**: The output sequence is then projected via the transposed token embedding weight matrix  to obtain the LLM prediction, and the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is minimized between this prediction and the expected LLM output.\n    - For speech recognition tasks, pre-defined prompts like \"Repeat the sentence: \" and \".\" are used to create the sequence.\n\n### Multi-Instructional Training:\n\nPrompts for multi-instructional training are sampled from a predefined handcrafted collection. The expected output in this context is generated by the LLM when using ground truth transcription token embeddings instead of the Adaptor output.\n\n### Innovations:\n\n1. **Adaptor Module**: The inclusion of an Adaptor module that bridges the gap between the speech encoder output and the LLM text token embeddings is crucial.\n2. **Two-Stage Training**: The method emphasizes a sequential training regimen to ensure effective learning, which is hypothesized to aid in learning different subtasks, such as segmentation, ordering, and token embedding prediction.\n3. **Multi-Instructional Training**: By using a variety of prompts and multi-instructional data, the methodology aims to enhance the model's robustness and versatility in understanding multilingual inputs.\n\nThis comprehensive training approach ensures that the Adaptor module effectively maps speech to text embeddings, allowing the LLM to accurately interpret multilingual speech.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\nThe primary experiment involves training an adaptor on a combination of two datasets: the entire FLEURS training dataset and a subset of the Common Voice Corpus 12.0 training dataset. The combined dataset consists of 993,660 utterances amounting to 1905 hours of recordings. Specifically, the Common Voice subset includes up to 25 hours of recordings for each language.\n\nThe validation set used is the FLEURS validation set, which consists of 34,044 utterances or 115 hours of recordings. Transcriptions within the datasets are unnormalized, maintaining true casing and punctuation.\n\nMulti-instructional training labels are synthesized using prompts from the P3 collection. The P3 collection is chosen due to its role in fine-tuning the BLOOM model into BLOOMZ, which the experiment aims to leverage for generating consistent outputs for both speech and text inputs. For the creation of training data, prompts from the P3 collection are applied to transcriptions of the original utterances. Six distinct prompts are used per transcription, and two generated outputs are associated with each of three speed-perturbed versions of that utterance. The text outputs are produced using greedy search with a maximum length of 128 tokens.\n\n### Baselines\nWhile the text does not specify comparison baselines explicitly, it implies the usage of a pre-existing model (BLOOMZ) as the standard for generating text outputs.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\nThe paper does not explicitly mention the exact evaluation metrics used to assess performance in the main experiment. However, given the context of text outputs and multi-instructional training, common evaluation metrics in similar setups typically include:\n- BLEU Score: to measure the correspondence between generated and reference texts.\n- WER (Word Error Rate): for evaluating the accuracy of speech-to-text transcription.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\nThe main experimental results are not described in detail within the provided text. To fully understand the outcomes, direct reference to the original paper would be necessary. Typically, such experiments would present improvements in BLEU scores, reductions in WER, or other metrics indicating better consistency between generated text outputs and transcriptions derived from speech inputs."
