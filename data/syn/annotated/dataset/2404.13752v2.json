    "abstract": "Since the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success, understanding and controlling their internal complex mechanisms has become an urgent problem. Recent research has attempted to interpret their behaviors through the lens of inner representation. However, developing practical and efficient methods for applying these representations for general and flexible model editing remains challenging. In this work, we explore how to use representation engineering methods to guide the editing of LLMs by deploying a representation sensor as an oracle. We first identify the importance of a robust and reliable sensor during editing, then propose an Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework to provide a unified and interpretable approach for conceptual model editing without compromising baseline performance. Experiments on multiple model editing paradigms demonstrate the effectiveness of ARE in various settings.

            "text": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a variety of tasks, their complex internal mechanism makes interpreting and censoring their behaviors (e.g., for safety alignment or hallucination reduction) challenging. To improve the interpretability and consequently the safety of LLMs, numerous efforts have been dedicated to interpreting the internal mechanisms from various perspectives like feature attribution, neuron analysis, and self-explanation.\n\nRecently, Zou et al. proposed the idea of Representation Engineering (RepE), which offers a way of understanding how LLMs work internally by focusing on the overall feature representations rather than individual neurons. Specifically, RepE extracts and analyzes the intermediate features of different concepts, enabling the monitoring of the internal behaviors of LLMs. More relevantly, RepE potentially allows editing and controlling the behaviors of LLMs by directly intervening in the internal hidden layers during inference. However, as RepE was essentially proposed to monitor the behaviors of LLMs, their proposed method for editing the model through representation vector incorporation is rather limited for practical uses. For instance, their method could disrupt the underlying structure of general LLMs, potentially hindering the model\u2019s performance. Additionally, the representation vector used for model editing may not be robust and heavily reliant on carefully chosen hyper-parameters, due to problems such as overfitting.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, in this work we investigate ways to efficiently fine-tune the model using the representations provided by RepE to achieve specific editing goals. Specifically, we attempt to train an oracle discriminator with the extracted representations given a particular goal of editing, then investigate how to use the discriminator to efficiently learn reliable representations and subsequently edit the model accordingly. However, we found that the trained discriminator may (expectedly) fit non-robust features and not be reliable for fine-tuning the models. Therefore, inspired by adversarial learning paradigms like GANs, we extend our idea to conduct adversarial training between the generative model and the discriminator to improve the reliability of the oracle model.\n\nMotivated by these studies, we propose an Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework, utilizing the internal representations and adversarial learning from the generative model and the discriminator. ARE efficiently and effectively edits LLMs by leveraging representation engineering techniques. In each epoch, it performs two key steps. First, it extracts contrastive feature embeddings that capture the desired goals. Secondly, it simultaneously trains both the LLM and the discriminator model. More details are discussed in the subsequent sections.\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of ARE on various editing and censoring tasks, including editing the alignment and honesty abilities. Specifically, on one hand, ARE can be used to enhance the safety alignment of existing LLMs effectively; on the other hand, it could also be used to easily remove the alignment for red-teaming goals as well. Compared with some existing fine-tuning-based methods, ARE can substantially decrease the refusal rate on harmful prompts from 20% to less than 1% on Llama2. Additionally, our ARE fine-tuned model can achieve the state-of-the-art TruthfulQA accuracy. These results present strong evidence of the practicalities of ARE in terms of editing and censoring LLMs."

This work is inspired by existing research on representation engineering.\nSince the significant capability of LLMs has sparked great research interest in understanding their internal mechanisms [54  ###reference_b54###, 37  ###reference_b37###],\nRepresentation engineering (RepE) [59  ###reference_b59###], which seeks understanding and controlling representations of high-level cognition in LLMs,\nhas revealed that there exist low-rank representations that can steer and control specific model capacity. Similar observations are also made in some specific scenarios, e.g. harmfulness [43  ###reference_b43###, 56  ###reference_b56###] and trustfulness [2  ###reference_b2###]. However, RepE did not provide a general solution to edit the model in a practical manner.\nAdversarial Learning. Our proposed method adopts adversarial learning intuitions to improve the reliability of representation discriminators. Adversarial training methods [27  ###reference_b27###, 4  ###reference_b4###, 50  ###reference_b50###], which optimizes the min-max optimization objective with worst-case performance, was first designed for improving the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial examples [40  ###reference_b40###, 9  ###reference_b9###, 5  ###reference_b5###]. In addition to the adversarial scenario, adversarial training has the benefit of making the representation and prediction more reliable [10  ###reference_b10###, 1  ###reference_b1###] and interpretable [34  ###reference_b34###, 38  ###reference_b38###], thus also been leveraged in other learning paradigms like image generation (GAN) [9  ###reference_b9###], domain generalization [8  ###reference_b8###, 39  ###reference_b39###] and contrastive learning [17  ###reference_b17###, 55  ###reference_b55###] for more robust representation. Our proposed framework also leverages the adversarial learning paradigm to make the oracle representation discriminator more robust and reliable.\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning. This work is related to parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Given the extremely large number of parameters in LLMs, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (PEFTs) are designed for tuning the LLM to be adapted to specific tasks with admissible computational overheads. Existing PEFTs can be mainly categorized as 1) module-based, which trains an extra small module in the model, like low-rank adaption (LoRA) [13  ###reference_b13###, 25  ###reference_b25###] and Adapters [12  ###reference_b12###, 31  ###reference_b31###], and 2) prompt-based which optimizes a prompt or embedding for the task [35  ###reference_b35###, 20  ###reference_b20###]. While most PEFTs are designed for specific tasks, how to efficiently edit the model knowledge and style remains underexplored [28  ###reference_b28###]."

            "text": "In this work, we focus primarily on LLMs, specifically decoder-only architectures, denoted as  where  represents model parameters. The model  is structured into several layers, collectively represented by the set , where each element  corresponds to the -th layer of the decoder.\nRepresentations. During the model  processes an input (prompt)  to generate outputs, it also provides representations in the hidden layers. These hidden states can be formulated as , where  specifically refers to the representation from the -th hidden layer when the model processes input . This architecture forms the basis for our analysis and further discussions in our work. Moreover, the response generated by the decoder model can be denoted as , where  denotes the set of all valid sentences.\nConcepts. Next, we define a concept  as the editing goal in the following. A concept applies to the responses generated by the model . Specifically, we introduce a judge function  to determine whether an input  aligns with the concept  (ideally judged by human oracle). For example, for the concept \"angry\",  outputs  if a response  is expressed in an angry manner, and 0 otherwise. In addition, for every concept , there is a corresponding negation  which the judgment function is defined as the negation of that for , i.e.\nConceptual model editing.\nWe are now ready to define the task of conceptual model editing. Assuming that the input prompts follow some implicit distribution  defined on the space , the task of conceptual editing, aimed at enhancing the concept , is to fine-tune the model such that the response  satisfies  for most inputs. This task is formally defined as\nIn general,\nit is infeasible to edit these concepts directly due to the inability to access the true distribution  or to implement the judgment function  perfectly. Therefore, a practical approach is to use a curated set of prompts to approximate these abstract concepts.\nThis set of prompts is referred to as anti-target inputs, denoted . Accordingly, our training objective becomes\nTo effectively demonstrate the target concept , we gather a set of prompts known as target inputs , which ideally trigger responses consistently exhibiting the target concept, such that . While exhibiting the target concept perfectly may not be feasible, the performance is expected to fulfill the following condition:\nFor example, consider the target concept of \"anger\" that we wish to attain (as illustrated in Figure 1  ###reference_###). To construct the anti-target inputs, we would gather a set of neutral prompts. Subsequently, to obtain the target inputs, we append the suffix \"respond in an angry manner.\" to each prompt. This modification aims to reliably trigger responses that exhibit \"anger\", thereby constituting an effective set of target inputs.\nRepresentation extraction from concepts.\nSince we have utilized the target input set  to illustrate the target concepts, the practical objective of fine-tuning shifts towards aligning the responses generated from  as closely as possible with those from . However, achieving token-level similarity is complex and overly fine-grained. Therefore, we employ a high-level approach known as representation engineering (RepE) [59  ###reference_b59###], which involves manipulating the representations, i.e. outcomes of an embedding function that maps the internal neural activities of each layer into the representation space .\nFor any given concept , the concept can be separated as a distinct feature set apart within this representation space of ,\nas examplified in Figure 3(a)  ###reference_sf1###.\nThe process of extracting these representations involves selecting tensors from the hidden states produced by processing an input  across specified layers . This process can be formally described by the mapping function , which transforms input space  to representation space as a subset of . A practical method for implementing this is to concatenate the hidden states from some selected layers.\nBy using these high-level representations, specifically target representations  and anti-target representations , we redefine our optimization goal. Representation serves as a proxy for the concept\u2019s embedded features, enabling the definition of a similarity function  that quantifies the differences between these two sets of representations. The training objective is therefore established as\nIn the next section, we delve deeper into the methods employed to achieve this objective. In particular, we show that the loss function  effectively functions as a discriminator."

To bridge this gap, we propose to train a representation discriminator to learn robust representations in an adversarial learning manner.

By iteratively updating this discriminator and the original model, we can facilitate a more refined and robust representation discriminator, forming the core of Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) as detailed in the following."

In this setup, a representation discriminator (akin to GAN\u2019s discriminator) assesses the generated representations, guiding the original LLM (similar to GAN\u2019s generator) to achieve the target concept. We show this duality in Figure 2  ###reference_###.\nIn Section 3  ###reference_###, we have shown that the concept can be derived from specifically designed input datasets. Note that the goal of editing is to minimize the gap between the representations from the two datasets as  and . Expressing the difference in features between the two sets above concisely through a single tensor or numerical metrics can be challenging. Therefore, we propose to encode this feature into a classifier in the form of simple neural network models. We define a discriminator for concept  as , which classifies whether a given representation exhibits the target concept. It accepts a representation vector and returns the confidence that it exhibits the concept. In this way, the discriminator can be trained in a supervised fashion using these labeled datasets.\nHowever, a discriminator trained on such (limited) datasets may not accurately capture the desired representation\u2019s feature due to the presence of numerous samples near the decision boundary and adversarial samples. For generalized conceptual editing, we aim to obtain (through the decoder model) a generalized and robust target presentation that works for all inputs. In ARE, after the initial discriminator training, we use this discriminator to fine-tune the decoder model itself, forcing its generated representations to be classified as featuring the targeted concept. Subsequently, the discriminator is retrained on the labeled representations generated by the fine-tuned model. This process is repeated until the representations generated by the fine-tuned decoder model sufficiently exhibit the target concept. The core idea is to allow the decoder model and the discriminator to be adversarial to each other, similar to the approach employed in GAN.\nThe overall editing algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1  ###reference_###. In this fine-tuning process, the decoder model  is treated as a representation generator rather than a language model. When processing an input, the representation vector is extracted from the hidden states of  and passed to the discriminator . Leveraging the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [13  ###reference_b13###] technique, we edit some selected layers of the generator  to maximize the probability of generating representations classified as the target class by the discriminator , while keeping the parameters of  frozen. Notably, the gradient can propagate through the entire framework by combining the generator and discriminator into a single model.\nTo provide a clear understanding of the alternative training process, we offer a visualization in Figure 3  ###reference_###. We compiled a set of 256 prompts, evenly divided between normal and malicious, with the expectation that the aligned model will reject all malicious inputs. The representations derived from these prompts are plotted using t-SNE, as depicted in the figure. In Subfigure 3(a)  ###reference_sf1###, we observe the initial distinct clustering of normal and malicious prompts. Our goal for model editing is to adjust these representations so that the two types of prompts yield similar responses. During the first epoch, illustrated in Subfigure 3(b)  ###reference_sf2###, the malicious prompts begin to converge towards the cluster of normal prompts. Since the two categories of representations remain distinct, necessitating further refinement of the discriminator. After 30 epochs of iterative training as shown in Subfigure 3(c)  ###reference_sf3###, we observe that the representation of normal prompts remains consistent, having been continuously classified correctly. Meanwhile, the representations of malicious prompts have nearly merged into the normal cluster, making it challenging for the classifier to distinguish them. At this stage, the differences in representations are minimal and can be considered negligible, indicating a successful editing process."

            "text": "Background. With the application of various safety training techniques, LLMs can often generate responses aligned with human values, but recent research has also revealed the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, particularly referred as jailbreaking. These attacks successfully craft malicious prompts that induce them to generate harmful outputs. Recognizing the need for combating such attacks (i.e., blue team) and for evaluating the risk brought by model editing techniques (i.e., red team), we evaluate the potential of applying ARE for editing the concept of alignment, i.e., to either enhance (defend) or remove (attack) the alignment ability of LLMs.\n\nExperiment Setup. We evaluate our methods using three open-source, aligned LLMs: Llama-2-7B-Chat, Vicuna-7B, and Guanaco-7B, for both attack and defense tasks. Our discriminator is a 2-layer neural network with a hidden layer consisting of 512 neurons. More details on the training of the discriminator can be found in Appendix A.1. \n\nTo measure the effectiveness of ARE, we consider three distinct categories of attack techniques as baselines, including 1) template-based attacks (In-Context Attack (1 shot) and DeepInception), 2) optimization-based attacks (GCG and AutoDAN), and 3) editing-based attacks (Contrast Vector from RepE, Shadow Alignment and harmful examples demonstration attack (HEDA)).\n\nNote that the optimization-based methods may demand more time to execute compared to others.\n\nFor the aspect of model defense, Self-Reminder and In-Context Defense are adopted as baseline defense strategies.\n\nExperimental Results. Tables present quantitative evaluations of our attack and defense results. The analysis of attack outcomes reveals that existing jailbreak attacks are not sufficiently effective, as indicated by low attack success rates, rendering them undesired for reliable red-teaming tasks. Conversely, our method, which employs editing-based attacks, demonstrates superior performance over all other listed editing-based approaches, achieving near-perfect success rates (close to 100%) against the most secure models like Llama-2.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis of various defense mechanisms against optimization-based attack strategies demonstrates that our modified model substantially improves the alignment and safety of the targeted models. Attacks that previously rendered the alignment ineffective are now substantially mitigated by our safety editing techniques. For instance, the attack success rates have markedly decreased to 41.1% for AutoDAN and 28.8% for GCG attacks on Vicuna. This result suggests that model editing may be considered an effective alternative or complementary approach to standard alignment methods such as RLHF."

            "text": "Background.\nExtensive prior research has demonstrated that LLMs may produce inaccurate or entirely fabricated information, a phenomenon often termed hallucinations. In this part, we explore the application of ARE for editing the hallucination extents of LLMs. Our objective is twofold: 1) amend LLMs to enhance their accuracy and truthfulness, thereby mitigating hallucinations; and 2) similar to the jailbreak scenario, for red-teaming purposes, to intentionally induce hallucinations. We remark that the latter is useful since there exists a demand to generate hallucinatory responses as a form of deterrent, aiming to discourage the occurrence of hallucinations in future instances.\n\nExperiment Setup.\nIn line with experimental protocols established by prior research, we curated target and anti-target prompts from the Alpaca Instruction Tuning Dataset, a dataset that contains various instructions covering multiple fields, hence mitigating task-specific biases. For training, we sample 500 instructions and randomly divide them into two balanced groups. We choose one group of prompts as the anti-target dataset without any perturbation. For the hallucination-enhancing task, the prompts are attached with the prefix \"Please give an untruthful answer,\" inducing the model to produce hallucinated responses. By contrast, for the hallucination-reducing goal, the target dataset was prompted with a prefix \"Please give a truthful answer,\" guiding the model towards accurate and reliable outputs.\n\nThe training regimen is inherently bidirectional, steering the model\u2019s representational outputs toward either the hallucinated or the truthful extremities. To demonstrate the versatility of our method without the need for task-specific hyper-parameters and settings, we employed the same settings as delineated in the Jailbreak tasks, with the sole variable being the dataset employed.\n\nEvaluation Metric.\nBuilding upon previous studies, we utilized the TrustfulQA benchmark for evaluating the tendency of models to produce hallucinations, which comprises 817 questions across 38 subcategories, each designed to potentially lead models towards incorrect beliefs, misconceptions, or biased responses. In its multiple-choice format, TrustfulQA provides an average of around 5 options per question, among which only one answer is factual, while the others include hallucinated content.\n\nFor hallucination evaluation, we adopt Correct Answer Rate (% Right Answer), defined as # Right Answer/ # Answer.\n\nExperiment Results.\nWe implemented bidirectional editing and benchmarked our approach against recent strategies aimed at mitigating hallucinations, including Self Reminder (prompting the inputs with prefix Please give a/an truthful/untruthful answer) and Inference-Time Intervention (ITI).\n\nThe outcomes of these comparisons show the efficacy of our model is evident, as our hallucination-enhancing editing led to a minimal number of correct responses; conversely, the hallucination-reduction editing significantly surpassed other evaluated approaches in both metrics, demonstrating that ARE effectively addresses hallucinations without diminishing the model\u2019s ability to provide valid responses. It is noteworthy that the model, after undergoing the editing process, exhibits improved performance relative to the target input set, showing the efficacy of our method. This enhancement also enables the post-editing model to achieve superior performance on tasks that were previously unattainable."

While the two aforementioned sections focus on evaluating how successful the editing is in terms of achieving the target concept, it is essential to assess the naturalness and usefulness of the generated texts. Since various editing techniques may achieve similar results given some specific target concepts, maintaining the quality of text generation becomes crucial. Current editing approaches, which focus on predefined and single target edits, typically produce models plagued by problems such as repetition and notably reduced diversity in the generated texts, as exemplified in Table 5 in Appendix A.3. For example, the outputs may lack variability, frequently recycling similar structures; for individual responses, sentences might be very similar or entirely repetitive. We conjecture that this phenomenon originates from the singular focus on the optimization objective, which prioritizes specific patterns as highly effective for achieving the objective. In contrast, our method employs a dynamic generation of optimization targets via the alternating training of a discriminator, ensuring that our optimization objectives are both natural and widely relevant.\n\nEvaluation Metrics. We leverage several quantitative metrics to assess the quality and diversity of the generated texts, benchmarked by the held-out test set in [49]. Drawing inspiration from prior quality and diversity evaluation of text generation [45, 24, 47], we adopt Repetition-4 to gauge phrase-level repetition and Repetition-Sen for measuring sentence-level repetition. Additionally, we utilize the Self-BLEU score [58], which measures the degree of similarity between segments of a text by comparing overlapping phrases within the text itself, serving as an indicator of both the uniqueness and variation in the generated content. Still, the generation process for all responses was standardized as the same as the default parameters used above.\n\nExperimental Results. The results of this analysis are tabulated in Table 4, which compares the efficacy of our editing method against a variety of alternative approaches. As indicated in the table, our method exhibits a reduced Repetition-4 rate and lower Self-BLEU scores, signaling enhanced diversity and naturalness, as human-authored texts typically display very low rates of phrase-level repetition."

Below, I summarize the motivation, research problem, and relevant prior work based on the introduction and related work sections provided:\n\n### Motivation\nDespite the impressive success of LLMs in a variety of tasks, their complex internal mechanisms pose significant challenges for interpreting and altering their behaviors, especially concerning safety alignment or mitigating hallucinations. The existing approaches to interpret LLMs\u2014from feature attribution and neuron analysis to self-explanation\u2014lack comprehensive solutions to robustly edit and control model behaviors while maintaining performance.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe key research problem the paper tackles is how to efficiently and effectively edit the behavior of LLMs using representation engineering techniques. Previous work, such as Representation Engineering (RepE), presented methods to monitor and understand LLMs by analyzing intermediate feature representations. However, these methods for editing LLMs were limited in practical applications due to potential disruption of the underlying structure and heavy reliance on chosen hyper-parameters, leading to issues like overfitting.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Feature Attribution**:\n   - Efforts in this area aim to improve LLM interpretability by linking model outputs to input features. Prior works cited include references [7, 36].\n\n2. **Neuron Analysis**:\n   - Investigations into understanding LLMs by analyzing individual neurons or groups of neurons for specific tasks or behaviors [11, 29].\n\n3. **Self-Explanation**:\n   - Methods that enable models to elucidate their decision-making processes from an internal perspective [15].\n\n4. **Representation Engineering (RepE)**:\n   - Proposed by Zou et al. [59], this method extracts and analyzes intermediate feature representations of concepts to monitor and potentially control LLM behaviors. However, its editing capabilities are limited and not robust for practical application.\n   - Although RepE can monitor behavior, its approach to editing LLMs using representation vectors can hinder model performance and is very sensitive to hyper-parameters.\n\n5. **Adversarial Learning Paradigms**:\n   - Inspired by methods such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [9], where a generator and discriminator are trained adversarially to improve each other's performance.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nThe paper introduces the Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework, combining representation engineering with adversarial training to edit and control LLM behaviors more reliably. ARE involves:\n- Extracting contrastive feature embeddings that capture specific editing goals.\n- Adversarial training between the generative model (the LLM) and a discriminator to learn reliable representations and edit the model.\n\n### Contributions and Results\nThe paper conducts extensive experiments demonstrating ARE's effectiveness in improving LLM editing tasks, such as enhancing safety alignment or reducing the refusal rate on harmful prompts. Results show significant improvements, including achieving state-of-the-art performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark, indicating that ARE is a practical and robust method for LLM editing and censoring.",
        "methodology": "### Proposed Method or Model\n\n**Core Focus and Architecture:**\nThe paper primarily focuses on enhancing and editing conceptual outputs of large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on decoder-only architectures. The methodology is structured around the model \\(\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) represents the model parameters. The model is organized into multiple layers \\(L\\), with each layer \\(\\ell_k\\) participating in the decoding process.\n\n**Representations:**\nWhile the model processes an input \\(x\\) to generate an output \\(y\\), it also yields hidden representations at each layer. These hidden states \\(h_{k}(x)\\) from the \\(k\\)-th layer play a crucial role in the analysis. The final response \\(y\\) generated by the decoder for an input \\(x\\) belongs to the set of all valid sentences \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\).\n\n**Concepts and Judgments:**\nThe paper defines a concept \\(c\\) as the editing goal related to the model\u2019s responses. A judge function \\(f_c(x)\\) determines if an input \\(x\\) aligns with concept \\(c\\). For example, for the concept \"angry,\" \\(f_{\\text{angry}}(x)\\) outputs 1 if the response \\( \\mathcal{M} (x) \\) is angry, and 0 otherwise. Each concept \\(c\\) also has a negation \\(\\neg c\\).\n\n**Conceptual Model Editing:**\nThe goal is to fine-tune the model so that for most inputs \\(x\\) from a distribution \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), the response \\(\\mathcal{M}(x)\\) aligns with concept \\(c\\). Due to practical constraints, direct editing isn\u2019t feasible. Instead, a curated set of prompts is used to approximate these concepts. These sets are named anti-target inputs \\(\\mathcal{X}_{\\neg c}\\) (neutral prompts) and target inputs \\(\\mathcal{X}_{c}\\) (prompts designed to trigger the target concept).\n\n**Practical Example:**\nFor the target concept \"anger,\" the anti-target inputs might be neutral prompts. Then, by appending \"respond in an angry manner.\" to these prompts, the set becomes \\(\\mathcal{X}_{c}\\), reliably triggering angry responses.\n\n**Representation Extraction:**\nThe method focuses on representation engineering (RepE) to manipulate high-level representations instead of token-level changes. From the hidden states produced by input \\(x\\), tensors from selected layers are extracted and concatenated into a mapping function \\(\\mathcal{F}_\\ell\\). This function transforms the input space \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) to representation space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\).\n\n**Optimization Goal:**\nThe target and anti-target representations are compared using a similarity function \\(g(\\mathcal{H}_c, \\mathcal{H}_{\\neg c})\\) that quantifies differences between these sets of representations. The training objective is to fine-tune the model such that the similarity function is optimized, ensuring that responses align closely with the target concept.\n\n### Key Innovations\n1. **Adversarial Representation Engineering:** \n   The innovative aspect lies in utilizing adversarially crafted target and anti-target prompts to refine and enhance the model's conceptual responses.\n\n2. **High-Level Representation Manipulation:**\n   Instead of fine-tuning at a granular token level, the method leverages high-level representational spaces for manipulating and optimizing concepts.\n   \n3. **Judge Function for Concepts:**\n   A systematic approach to determine alignment with concepts via a defined judge function.\n\n4. **Two-Tiered Training Approach:**\n   Utilizing both target and anti-target inputs to create a balanced and robust editing mechanism for conceptual refinement.\n\n5. **Similarity-based Optimization:**\n   Employing a similarity function to measure and optimize the alignment of representations with desired concepts.\n\nIn the subsequent sections of the paper, the practical implementation and deeper methodological specifics are discussed, particularly highlighting the loss function's role as a discriminator in achieving the optimization objective.",

The experimental setup consists of attack and defense tasks, utilizing a 2-layer neural network discriminator. The Advbench dataset, comprising 500 malicious prompts, was used to test the editing outcomes. Different categories of attack techniques were used as baselines, including template-based (In-Context Attack, DeepInception), optimization-based (GCG, AutoDAN), and editing-based attacks (Contrast Vector from RepE, Shadow Alignment, HEDA). For defense, the study used Self-Reminder and In-Context Defense strategies as baselines.",
            "result_discussion": "The results, shown in Tables 1 and 2, indicate that existing jailbreak attacks have low success rates, whereas the ARE approach demonstrates superior performance with near-perfect success rates in attack scenarios. For defense tasks, ARE significantly reduced the success rates of attacks like AutoDAN (to 41.1%) and GCG (to 28.8%) on Vicuna. This underlines the efficacy of using model editing methods via ARE as a robust alternative or complementary approach to traditional alignment methods.",
