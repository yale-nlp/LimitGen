    "title": "Phase Transitions in the Output Distribution of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "In a physical system, changing parameters such as temperature can induce a phase transition: an abrupt change from one state of matter to another. Analogous phenomena have recently been observed in large language models. Typically, the task of identifying phase transitions requires human analysis and some prior understanding of the system to narrow down which low-dimensional properties to monitor and analyze. Statistical methods for the automated detection of phase transitions from data have recently been proposed within the physics community. These methods are largely system agnostic and, as shown here, can be adapted to study the behavior of large language models. In particular, we quantify distributional changes in the generated output via statistical distances, which can be efficiently estimated with access to the probability distribution over next-tokens. This versatile approach is capable of discovering new phases of behavior and unexplored transitions \u2013 an ability that is particularly exciting in light of the rapid development of language models and their emergent capabilities.",

            "text": "Colloquially, the term phase transition refers to a change among the basic phases of matter. For example, in response to changes in external conditions such as temperature or pressure, water can transition to a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. More broadly, in physics a phase transition refers to an abrupt change in the macroscopic behavior of a large-scale system of interacting constituents [1  ###reference_b1###, 2  ###reference_b2###]. Notable examples include transitions in the magnetic properties of materials [3  ###reference_b3###], transitions from a normal conducting state to a superconductor [4  ###reference_b4###], transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum circuit [5  ###reference_b5###], or the collective motion of active matter such as a flock of birds [6  ###reference_b6###].\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, \u201cphase transition\u201d-like phenomena have also been observed in the learning behavior of neural networks (NNs) [1  ###reference_b1###, 7  ###reference_b7###, 8  ###reference_b8###, 9  ###reference_b9###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 11  ###reference_b11###, 12  ###reference_b12###, 13  ###reference_b13###, 14  ###reference_b14###, 15  ###reference_b15###, 16  ###reference_b16###]. For example, during training, AlphaZero [17  ###reference_b17###] underwent periods of rapid knowledge acquisition in which increasingly sophisticated chess openings were favored by the engine [9  ###reference_b9###]. Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to make sudden improvements in their inductive abilities during training which is related to the formation of special circuitry (so-called induction heads) [18  ###reference_b18###]. Similar abrupt improvements in specific capabilities, often referred to as breakthroughs, have been observed for a variety of different models and tasks [19  ###reference_b19###, 20  ###reference_b20###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 23  ###reference_b23###, 24  ###reference_b24###, 12  ###reference_b12###, 25  ###reference_b25###, 26  ###reference_b26###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 27  ###reference_b27###]. Moreover, phenomena such as double descent [28  ###reference_b28###, 29  ###reference_b29###] or grokking [30  ###reference_b30###, 31  ###reference_b31###, 32  ###reference_b32###, 33  ###reference_b33###, 34  ###reference_b34###, 35  ###reference_b35###] are also reminiscent of phase transitions in physics.\nThe detection of phase transitions111In the following, we adopt a more general definition of a phase transition as a sudden shift in the qualitative behavior of a system as a function of a control parameter [1  ###reference_b1###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. in deep learning systems may improve our understanding and eventually enable better model training. For example, an in-depth analysis of the grokking transition [30  ###reference_b30###, 37  ###reference_b37###] led to a way for accelerating generalization [32  ###reference_b32###]. Moreover, it has been shown that models are highly sensitive to perturbations, such as data corruptions, at critical points [38  ###reference_b38###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. Being able to predict the behavior of models is also crucial for ensuring safe model deployment [19  ###reference_b19###] as well as for projecting the performance of future model versions and optimally allocating resources for their training [39  ###reference_b39###].\nThe characterization of phase transitions in physics is difficult because the state of the systems to be studied typically lives in a very high-dimensional space and is probabilistic in nature, meaning that for given values of the tuning parameters we can find the system in various states. Physicists solve this problem by finding a suitable set of a few low-dimensional quantities, called order parameters [2  ###reference_b2###], which capture the essence of each phase of the system. For example, even though water is a highly complex system, we can detect the liquid-gas transition by looking at the density which shows a sudden jump at the boiling point and, in this case, serves as an order parameter. However, finding such a suitable set of order parameters is \u201cconsidered an art\u201d [2  ###reference_b2###], as it requires a great deal of human intuition as well as prior understanding.\nFaced with the task of characterizing phase transitions in learning systems based on large NNs, similar issues are encountered. NNs contain an enormous amount of trainable parameters and their state space, as characterized by their neural activations, is huge. This problem is exacerbated in generative models such as LLMs where also the output space is large, i.e., the high dimensionality cannot be foregone by treating the inside of the NN as a black box and focusing solely on its output characteristics. Understanding LLMs from first principles has been notoriously hard [40  ###reference_b40###]. Theories capturing their microscopic and macroscopic behavior, for instance based on mechanistic interpretability [41  ###reference_b41###, 18  ###reference_b18###, 42  ###reference_b42###, 34  ###reference_b34###, 43  ###reference_b43###] or neural scaling laws [44  ###reference_b44###, 45  ###reference_b45###, 39  ###reference_b39###, 46  ###reference_b46###, 47  ###reference_b47###, 48  ###reference_b48###, 49  ###reference_b49###, 27  ###reference_b27###], are still nascent. In particular, the definition of appropriate low-dimensional quantities that facilitate the detection of transitions has been done manually, for example through the extraction of appropriate circuitry [50  ###reference_b50###, 51  ###reference_b51###, 43  ###reference_b43###]. Due to this human-in-the-loop, transitions can be easily missed [43  ###reference_b43###] or spuriously induced [52  ###reference_b52###].\nIn physics, these problems have been tackled using statistical methods for the detection of phase transitions from data, which requires minimal prior system knowledge and human input [53  ###reference_b53###, 54  ###reference_b54###, 55  ###reference_b55###, 56  ###reference_b56###, 57  ###reference_b57###, 58  ###reference_b58###, 59  ###reference_b59###, 60  ###reference_b60###, 61  ###reference_b61###, 62  ###reference_b62###, 63  ###reference_b63###, 64  ###reference_b64###, 65  ###reference_b65###, 66  ###reference_b66###, 67  ###reference_b67###, 68  ###reference_b68###, 69  ###reference_b69###, 70  ###reference_b70###, 71  ###reference_b71###, 72  ###reference_b72###, 73  ###reference_b73###, 74  ###reference_b74###, 75  ###reference_b75###]. Inspired by this body of work, we here adapt such an approach for the automated detection of phase transitions in LLMs. The method is based on measuring changes in the distribution of the text output of LLMs via generic statistical distances belonging to the family of -divergences, making it a versatile all-purpose tool for objectively and automatically mapping out phase diagrams of generative models. Such an approach has the potential to characterize unexplored phase transitions and potentially discover new phases of behaviors. This is crucial in light of the rapid development of LLMs [76  ###reference_b76###, 77  ###reference_b77###, 78  ###reference_b78###] and their emergent capabilities [19  ###reference_b19###, 20  ###reference_b20###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 23  ###reference_b23###, 24  ###reference_b24###, 79  ###reference_b79###, 18  ###reference_b18###, 80  ###reference_b80###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 25  ###reference_b25###, 26  ###reference_b26###, 10  ###reference_b10###].\nAs a demonstration, we characterize transitions occurring as a function of three different control parameters in Pythia [81  ###reference_b81###], Mistral (7B) [82  ###reference_b82###], and Llama3 (8B) [83  ###reference_b83###] language models: an integer occurring in the input prompt, the temperature hyperparameter for text generation, and the model\u2019s training epoch.\nWe find that\nthe instruction-tuned Llama and Mistral models seem to have the capability to order integers whereas all considered base models do not.\nchanges in integer tokenization can be visible in the text output as sharp transitions.\nthree distinct phases of behavior as a function of an LLM\u2019s temperature can be mapped out: a deterministic \u201cfrozen\u201d phase near zero temperature, an intermediate \u201ccoherent\u201d phase, and a \u201cdisordered\u201d phase at high temperatures.\nan LLM\u2019s \u201cheat capacity\u201d with respect to the temperature can be negative, i.e., the LLM\u2019s mean energy can decrease as its temperature is increased.\nrapid changes in the distribution of weights during training can coincide with transitions in the text output that are present across many prompts.\ndifferent prompts result in different transition times during training, suggesting that distinct type of behavior can be learned rapidly at distinct times in training."

That is, values of the parameter at which the distribution changes strongly are considered critical points where phase transitions occur. While it is possible to generalize our approach to distributions conditioned on multiple control parameters, for simplicity we consider the one-dimensional scenario in the following. We quantify the rate of change using -divergences, as they have particularly nice properties, such as satisfying the data processing inequality. Given a convex function with , the corresponding -divergence is a statistical distance defined as Prominent examples of -divergences include the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, which corresponds to a symmetrized and smoothened version of the KL divergence, as well as the total variation (TV) distance. Ideally, we would also like the statistical distance we choose to be symmetric. This condition is only satisfied by the TV distance and the JS divergence among the examples above. Hence, in this work, we will focus on the TV distance corresponding to , as well as the JS divergence corresponding to , where is the KL divergence. The TV distance and the JS divergence have also had tremendous success in detecting phase transitions in physical systems without prior system knowledge under the name of \u201clearning-by-confusion.\u201d Note that both the TV distance and the JS divergence form lower bounds to the KL divergence and other -divergence, such as the divergence. In this sense, detecting a large dissimilarity in terms of the TV distance or the JS divergence also signals a large dissimilarity in other measures."

            "text": "Having defined appropriate notions of distance between probability distributions, we now describe their use to detect phase transitions: Consider a sampled set of control parameter values, forming a uniform one-dimensional grid. For each point lying halfway in between grid points, we assess whether it is a critical point by computing a dissimilarity score between the distributions underlying the segments to the left and to the right of it. Denoting the cardinality of the segment as \\( n \\), we can write these probabilities as \\( P(n) \\) for each segment. Critical points where phase transitions occur can then be identified as local maxima in this score.\n\nFor simplicity, we proceed with segments of equal length for the rest of this article, and define the length \\( l \\) as the number of parameter values to the left or right of the point that characterize the segment. We are free to adjust it according to the problem, as \\( l \\) sets a natural length scale on which changes in the distributions are assessed. Examples will be discussed in Sec. 3. In particular, for small values and neighboring parameter points separated by \\( \\epsilon \\), \\( D_\\epsilon(f || g) \\rightarrow I_F \\), where \\( I_F \\) is the Fisher information. That is, local changes in a distribution as measured by any -divergence reduce to the Fisher information in the limit.\n\nHaving the Fisher information as a limiting case is a desirable property: It is a well-known, generic statistical measure for quantifying how sensitive probability distributions are to changes in their parameters and its behavior is well-understood when used to detect phase transitions in physical systems."

            "text": "Before concluding, let us discuss how our method relates to other approaches for studying transitions in LLMs.\nGeneric performance-based analysis. Many previous works found transitions in LLM behavior by locating sharp changes in generic performance measures, such as sudden drops in training loss [18  ###reference_b18###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. While this may capture transitions in the overall behavior, such an approach cannot resolve transitions in specific LLM behavior. In particular, it may miss algorithmic transitions where the same performance is reached but by different means [43  ###reference_b43###].\nPrompt-specific success metrics. Other works have found transitions by looking at success metrics tailored toward specific prompts [20  ###reference_b20###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 23  ###reference_b23###, 24  ###reference_b24###, 25  ###reference_b25###, 113  ###reference_b113###]. Recalling the example studied in Sec. 3.1  ###reference_###, this would correspond to assigning a score of 1 if the LLM provided the correct answer to the question  and 0 otherwise. Similarly, one could compute such a score in a temporal analysis (Sec. 3.3  ###reference_###) or for detecting transitions as a function of another hyperparameter (Sec. 3.2  ###reference_###). A downside of this approach is that it is restricted to prompts that allow for a clear score to be assigned. In particular, choosing an appropriate scoring function may require lots of human engineering. Moreover, discontinuous metrics can artificially induce transitions where the underlying behavior varies smoothly [52  ###reference_b52###]. Similarly, they may miss transitions where the same performance is reached but by different means [43  ###reference_b43###].\nMeasures based on model internals. The aforementioned approaches are based on the model output. Many works have also detected transitions based on changes in the internal structure of models, such as its trainable parameters [115  ###reference_b115###, 36  ###reference_b36###] (similar to the weight-based analysis we have performed in Sec. 3.3  ###reference_###). However, access to model internals may not always be available. Moreover, the design of measures that capture specific transitions in behavior requires lots of human input [50  ###reference_b50###, 51  ###reference_b51###, 43  ###reference_b43###], e.g., using insights from the field of mechanistic interpretability."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\n\nThe paper is motivated by the observation that \"phase transition\"-like phenomena, commonly studied in physics, have also been seen in artificial intelligence, particularly in the learning behavior of large neural networks (NNs) and large language models (LLMs). These transitions are characterized by abrupt changes in the system\u2019s behavior, such as rapid knowledge acquisition or breakthroughs in specific capabilities, resembling physical phase transitions like liquid-gas transitions in water. Identifying and understanding these transitions in LLMs could improve model training, enhance predictions about model behavior, and lead to safer and more efficient deployment of these models.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe primary research problem addressed in this paper is the automated detection and characterization of phase transitions in the output distribution of large language models (LLMs). These models have vast state spaces due to their numerous trainable parameters and large output spaces, making it difficult to manually identify low-dimensional quantities that indicate phase transitions. The paper seeks a method that requires minimal human input and prior system knowledge, aiming to robustly detect these transitions in a manner akin to statistical methods used in physics.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\n1. **Phase Transitions in Physics**:\n   - Phase transitions in physics involve sudden changes in macroscopic behavior and are often captured via suitable low-dimensional quantities called order parameters [1 ###reference_b1###, 2 ###reference_b2###]. Examples include transitions in magnetic properties [3 ###reference_b3###], superconductivity [4 ###reference_b4###], and collective motion in active matter [6 ###reference_b6###].\n\n2. **Phase Transitions in Neural Networks**:\n   - Neural networks exhibit phase transition-like phenomena during learning, such as in AlphaZero\u2019s rapid knowledge acquisition [17 ###reference_b17###]. LLMs have shown similar abrupt improvements during training, related to the formation of special circuitry [18 ###reference_b18###].\n\n3. **Model Sensitivity and Generalization**:\n   - Understanding phase transitions in models can aid in predicting model behavior, enhancing generalization [30 ###reference_b30###, 37 ###reference_b37###], and ensuring safe deployment [19 ###reference_b19###]. Models are sensitive to perturbations at critical points [38 ###reference_b38###, 36 ###reference_b36###].\n\n4. **Detection Methods**:\n   - Statistical methods used in physics for detecting phase transitions [53 ###reference_b53###, 54 ###reference_b54###] reduce the need for extensive human intuition and prior knowledge. The paper adapts such methods to identify phase transitions in LLMs using changes in output distribution measured by statistical distances.\n\n5. **Challenges in Understanding LLMs**:\n   - LLMs\u2019 complex behavior has been hard to model from first principles [40 ###reference_b40###], requiring advances in mechanistic interpretability [41 ###reference_b41###] and neural scaling laws [44 ###reference_b44###]. Manual approaches to defining order parameters for detecting transitions pose risks of missing or spuriously inducing transitions [43 ###reference_b43###, 52 ###reference_b52###].\n\nBy leveraging and extending these foundational concepts and methods, the paper aims to provide an automated, objective technique for mapping phase transitions in LLMs, which is critical given the rapid advancements and growing capabilities of these models.",

For this study, we focus on every second model in this range, specifically the models with 70M, 410M, 1.4B, and 6.9B parameters.\n\n**Mistral Family:** From the Mistral family, we analyze the base model Mistral-7B-v0.1, which has 7.3B parameters. We also consider the fine-tuned version of this base model known as Mistral-7B-Instruct [82  ###reference_b82###], which was also released in 2023.\n\n**Llama 3:** This suite of models, developed by Meta AI and released in 2024, includes the Llama-3 model with 8B parameters. Additionally, we examine NVIDIA's chat-tuned version of Llama 3, termed Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B [107  ###reference_b107###]. For the chat-tuned model, we use inputs that are formatted accordingly to match the intended use case.\n\nKey components in our methodology involve comparing these various models across sizes and variations to investigate phase transitions in their output distributions. By focusing on a representative subset of models from each suite (varying in size and training objectives), the study aims to highlight significant changes in model behavior that occur as we scale up model parameters.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup and Results:**\n\nIn this study, the authors examine how different parameters influence the output distribution of a language model by conducting experiments in three fundamental ways:\n\n1. **As a variable within the input prompt**: The authors explore the impacts of varying integers injected into the input prompt. This particular experiment focuses on understanding how the content of the input prompt might affect the behavior and output of the language model.\n\n2. **As a hyperparameter controlling the application of the trained language model**: The temperature is varied to see its effects on the generated output. Temperature is a critical hyperparameter that can influence the diversity and creativity of the language model's responses.\n\n3. **As a training hyperparameter of the language model**: The number of training epochs is modified to observe how continued training affects the output distribution. This experiment aims to capture the effects of prolonged training on the performance and output of the model.\n\n**Datasets:**\n- The paper does not specify the exact datasets used for these experiments in the provided sections. However, it is implied that the language model was tested on standard language modeling tasks.\n\n**Baselines:**\n- Specific baseline models are not mentioned in the provided content. The main focus appears to be on observing changes across different experimental conditions rather than comparing different models.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\n- The main evaluation metrics are not explicitly given in the provided text. Typically, language models' performance might be assessed using metrics like perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation, depending on the output's quality and context.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\n- The results for each experiment would likely detail how the distribution of outputs shifts in response to changes in the integer prompt, temperature settings, and the number of epochs trained. However, specific quantitative or qualitative results are not provided in the text.\n\nWithout further detailed results and metrics, the description offers a high-level overview of the experimental setup aimed at understanding the influence of various parameters on language model output distributions."

Dissimilarities were computed based on various f-functions, with a focus on linear dissimilarity. Additionally, experiments were repeated with other base models like Llama3-8B, Mistral base models, and Pythia models of various sizes using different integer prompts.",
            "result_discussion": "The results showed a clear peak around x = 42 for Mistral-7B-Instruct, indicating a distinct phase transition. Llama3-8B and Mistral base models showed no clear peak, while Pythia models showed a peak between x = 6 and 7, likely due to tokenizer behavior. Another peak observed around x = 2021 for Mistral and Llama3-8B models was attributed to training data timelines.",
