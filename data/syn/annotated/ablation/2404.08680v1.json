    "abstract": "This research pioneers the use of finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs), presenting a significant and novel contribution in integrating AI to enhance academic research methodologies. Our study employed the latest finetuning methodologies together with open-sourced LLMs, and demonstrated a practical and efficient approach to automating the final execution stages of an SLR process that involves knowledge synthesis. The results maintained high fidelity in factual accuracy in LLM responses, and were validated through the replication of an existing PRISMA-conforming SLR. Our research proposed solutions for mitigating LLM hallucination and proposed mechanisms for tracking LLM responses to their sources of information, thus demonstrating how this approach can meet the rigorous demands of scholarly research. The findings ultimately confirmed the potential of finetuned LLMs in streamlining various labour-intensive processes of conducting literature reviews. Given the potential of this approach and its applicability across all research domains, this foundational study also advocated for updating PRISMA reporting guidelines to incorporate AI-driven processes, ensuring methodological transparency and reliability in future SLRs. This study broadens the appeal of AI-enhanced tools across various academic and research fields, setting a new standard for conducting comprehensive and accurate literature reviews with more efficiency in the face of ever-increasing volumes of academic studies.",

            "text": "Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) serve as the bedrock of academic research, playing a crucial role in the amalgamation, examination, and synthesis of existing scholarly knowledge across various fields[1  ###reference_b1###, 2  ###reference_b2###, 3  ###reference_b3###]. These reviews offer a methodical and replicable approach, ensuring the integrity and thoroughness of research synthesis especially when combined with reporting guidelines like PRISMA [4  ###reference_b4###, 5  ###reference_b5###, 6  ###reference_b6###]. Such a foundation is indispensable for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications. However, the traditional execution of SLRs is marked by its manual and resource-intensive nature, often stretching over extensive periods, which introduces significant inefficiencies into the research process [7  ###reference_b7###, 8  ###reference_b8###].\nThe rigorous yet cumbersome character of traditional SLR methodologies presents considerable bottlenecks in the management and synthesis of large datasets of selected studies that hinges on effective information retrieval [9  ###reference_b9###, 10  ###reference_b10###]. These challenges not only prolong the synthesis - the execution phase of a review - but also hamper the ongoing updates of the SLRs with newer findings, and risk diminishing the timeliness and relevance of the insights gleaned[11  ###reference_b11###, 12  ###reference_b12###]. This scenario underscores the need for innovative, scalable and sustainable solutions that can streamline the extraction of information from findings situated in academic papers, as well as its persistence in suitable information technologies which facilitate their accurate and effective retrieval necessary for executing SLRs [13  ###reference_b13###, 14  ###reference_b14###].\nThe recent advent of a new class of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems like Large Language Models (LLMs), heralds a new epoch with the potential to dramatically redefine the SLR landscape through the automation of the information retrieval processes while maintaining high factual fidelity [15  ###reference_b15###, 8  ###reference_b8###]. These models, with their advanced natural language comprehension capabilities, text generation and knowledge retention [16  ###reference_b16###], offer a promising avenue for automating and optimizing various stages of the SLR process [17  ###reference_b17###], and in particular the execution phase that relies on \u201ctalking to\u201d both individual academic papers via LLMs, as well as simultaneously \u201ctalking across\u201d all target papers for synthesising purposes [18  ###reference_b18###]. Despite their potential, the broad generalist pretraining of these models which have been trained on vast amounts of diverse text data means that the LLMs fall short in providing the domain-specific accuracy and precision in the information retrieved that is essential for the detailed task of knowledge synthesis across a very specific and narrow sets of studies. Additionally, their current propensity to hallucinate [19  ###reference_b19###, 20  ###reference_b20###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 22  ###reference_b22###] renders them unable to consistently respond accurately, which precludes them from providing reliable responses needed to conduct SLRs with integrity. Additionally, current LLMs have variable abilities to audit and track the sources of their responses [23  ###reference_b23###]. Their inability to reliably ensure that the provenance of the LLM responses can be linked to the target studies that comprise an SLR corpus represents a serious limitation for using this technology for this purpose. Collectively, these gaps highlight a critical area within AI-assisted SLR processes for the purpose of enhancing the information retrieval capabilities of LLMs [24  ###reference_b24###]. Indeed, resent research has repeatedly raised these concerns with respect to using LLM for the purposes of SLRs, especially in the knowledge synthesis stages. While it has been suggested that LLMs could be used for assisting evidence synthesis tasks in SLRs via their summarization capabilities, concerns have been raised about their lack of continuous learning capability and temporal reasoning [25  ###reference_b25###, 26  ###reference_b26###]. Qureshi et al. [27  ###reference_b27###] noted that using LLMs shows promise for aiding in systematic review-related tasks, but the authors concluded that the technology is in its infancy and requires significant development for such applications. In their most recent review, Bolanos et al. [28  ###reference_b28###] found that LLM usage for SLRs is hampered by limitations such as reduced efficacy in domain-specific and narrower subject areas, their propensity for hallucinating and generating misleading information, alongside their opaque decision processes which cannot be audited.\nTo surmount these challenges, this study proposes the creation of finetuned open-source LLMs, trained on the corpus of selected academic papers for a target SLR, expanding the generalist knowledge of an LLM with narrower domain-specific expertise. This work devises a novel way to automatically extract information from a set of academic papers in order to create SLR-specific datasets which can be leveraged for finetuning LLMs so that they can support question and answering downstream tasks. We also devise mechanisms to mitigate LLM hallucination and to ensure that all LLM responses related to an SLR can be tracked to source studies.\nThe ensuing research presents a comprehensive SLR-automation framework with a focus on the knowledge synthesis stage that\naims to revolutionize information retrieval mechanisms with empirical evidence of their effectiveness, thereby expediting and transforming the synthesis of research findings in the context of SLRs."

The challenges here lie in maintaining the integrity and context of individual studies while seeking commonalities or divergent themes across the body of evidence [38  ###reference_b38###]. The subjective nature of this synthesis approach underscores the need for transparency and reflexivity in the analytical process, ensuring that the synthesis is both comprehensive and faithful to the original studies [39  ###reference_b39###].

This challenge is particularly acute given the stringent requirements for accuracy and reliability in SLR research, where any deviation from factual correctness can significantly undermine the integrity of the review process and its outcomes. Hallucinations can generally be categorized into two types, namely, open-domain and closed domain hallucinations [19  ###reference_b19###].\nHallucinations in open-domain contexts emerge when LLMs produce outputs not directly anchored in specific instances of the training data. This type of hallucination is particularly problematic in the context of SLRs, where the veracity of information is paramount. Strategies to mitigate open-domain hallucinations include enhancing the diversity and representativeness of training datasets, incorporating mechanisms for better context comprehension, and developing techniques for the LLM to recognize and flag potential inaccuracies. Meanwhile, closed-domain hallucinations occur within specific contexts, such as when LLMs generate content that diverges from the source text in tasks like translation or summarization. For SLRs, where synthesis of existing literature must adhere closely to the original texts, such hallucinations clearly pose significant risks.\nReasons for LLMs generating hallucinations is commonly attributed to the presence of false information within the training data itself [65  ###reference_b65###] or to the outdated or temporal nature of the training data which lacks information on recent developments [66  ###reference_b66###]. However, these are not the sole contributors to hallucinations. Another factor is the LLMs\u2019 training approach to generate tokens sequentially, which can result in generating realistic but ultimately incorrect sequences of text [67  ###reference_b67###]. Recently, [19  ###reference_b19###] demonstrated that LLMs inherently produce incorrect facts due to statistical principles rather than their design or data quality, with such errors often corresponding to the rate at which certain unique facts appear in the training data."

Unlike traditional language models that generate text based solely on the text\u2019s internal representation, RAG models retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base (like a database or the internet) and integrate this into the generation process. The core components of RAG include the retrieval mechanism, which fetches relevant documents or data, and the generative model, which synthesizes the retrieved information into coherent and contextually relevant responses. The theoretical principles underpinning RAG stem from the need to enhance language models with the ability to access and utilize external, structured knowledge [69  ###reference_b69###]. This is in response to the limitations of traditional LLMs that rely solely on their pre-trained parameters for knowledge, which can be outdated or incomplete. The typical architecture of RAG systems involves a retriever that fetches relevant information from a database and a generator that incorporates this information into the final output, thus, the integration of these components allows the model to produce contextually enriched and factually accurate text [68  ###reference_b68###].\nThe incorporation of RAG into the workflow of LLMs, therefore, presents a sophisticated approach to augmenting the model\u2019s knowledge base beyond its pretraining, specifically tailored to the demands of the evolving nature of studies in SLRs. By allowing the model to access an external corpus of domain-specific literature the context within which the LLM operates, it attains the ability to be enriched while a critical countermeasure to the model\u2019s propensity for generating plausible yet factually incorrect information - hallucination - is mitigated. In the realm of SLRs, where the precision of synthesized knowledge is paramount, RAG\u2019s ability to draws upon relevant information from a targeted corpus helps ensure that the generative outputs of LLMs are anchored in verifiable data."

The viability of the proposed framework is explored and illustrated using a case study that will seek to replicate a PRISMA-conforming SLR as a ground truth against which the proposed framework can be evaluated.\nBased on the research gaps in the literature, this study attempts to answer the following research questions:\n(RQ1) Can we leverage LLMs in combination with finetuning and/or RAG in order to facilitate the synthesis phase of an SLR process?\n(RQ2) How can the extraction of finetuning datasets from an SLR corpus be effectively automated?\n(RQ3) Can finetuning of LLMs be effectively conducted on relatively small datasets representing a very narrow domain?\n(RQ4) Can we achieve high fidelity of LLM responses and ensure that we can audit and verify the source information of LLM responses, and what evaluation metrics are suitable?\n(RQ5) Are the proposed SLR-automation approaches viable for replicating a previously published SLR study?"

The motivation behind this approach is to achieve a higher degree of fidelity and precision in the model\u2019s output during inference. When an LLM is fine-tuned with additional data, it assimilates this new information by adjusting a small percentage of its existing parameters while adding a larger set of new parameters. Without a mechanism to distinguish between pre-existing knowledge acquired from pretraining and newly acquired information, the model risks providing responses based on its pretraining rather than the domain-specific insights gained from the subsequent fine-tuning step. Since it is imperative that during inference time, the model does not access facts from its knowledge base developed during pretraining, and instead, only responds with facts acquired during finetuning, an explicit mechanism is needed to ensure this occurs. Without such mechanisms, the results of the SLR risk being contaminated with knowledge that is outside of the scope of the selected papers, thus, invalidating the research. In essence, the aim of the proposed approach is to insulate the LLMs responses from its pretrained knowledge but to nonetheless leverage its natural language capabilities that it gained during pretraining.\nTherefore, these tokens or markers serve as signposts within the neural network, directing the model to access and utilize the parameters associated with the SLR data and facts when generating responses. It also enables the model to explicitly state the source information for its responses so that the provenance of information can be audited.\nThis approach provides a method for researchers to verify that the output is indeed based on the recent fine-tuning, enabling a level of interpretability and trust in the model\u2019s responses that is critical for academic rigor and reliability and represents a strategic advancement in using LLMs for SLR."

For each original question, we create several semantically equivalent variations. Since accurate recall of facts is the primary objective of the system rather than style, linguistic quality, and variability of the text, we retain the same answer for each permutation of the corresponding questions.

To enhance the finetuning efficiency, we propose employing PEFT techniques [71  ###reference_b71###], which modify only a subset of the model\u2019s parameters. This is crucial, as fine-tuning all parameters of large LLMs is computationally prohibitive and may not yield proportionate improvements in performance. PEFT techniques offer a balance, concentrating the model\u2019s learning capacity on those parameters that most significantly influence the domain-specific tasks, thereby optimizing both resource expenditure and model proficiency. RAG, on the other hand, serves as an augmentative mechanism during inference. It dynamically retrieves and incorporates information from the SLR corpus into the LLM\u2019s generative process, potentially providing an additional layer of contextual support. This optional step may ensure that the model\u2019s output is not solely reliant on internalized patterns but is also substantiated by direct data references, thereby potentially enriching the depth and factual accuracy of the synthesized content and responses."

The first was FEVER, whose usage is consistent with other studies concerning factual text evaluations. The next was a variation on FEVER which we refer to as the Consistency Grading Scale (CGS) that offers a more granular analysis of the alignment between response texts and reference materials.\n\nFEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification): The FEVER metric was a key evaluation framework used in conjunction with GPT-4 to automate the testing. FEVER scoring is designed to assess the factual accuracy of generated responses by cross-referencing them against ground truth responses. FEVER scoring determines the veracity of the claims, categorizing them into distinct labels for clarity. The labels used in the standard FEVER evaluation are:\nSUPPORTED : The claim is directly corroborated by the evidence in the ground truth test set.\nREFUTED: The claim is directly contradicted by the evidence in the ground truth test set.\nNOT ENOUGH INFO: There is insufficient evidence in the ground truth test set to either support or refute the claim.\n\nConsistency Grading Scale (CGS): Building upon the foundational principles of FEVER, CGS introduces a more granular continuum for evaluating the fidelity of information presented by LLM responses. This grading scale quantitatively assesses the alignment of generated responses with verified reference texts, offering a spectrum of consistency levels ranging from complete contradiction to full support. The CGS is defined as follows:\nFully Consistent (2): The claim in the response text is unambiguously corroborated by the evidence in the ground truth.\nPartially Consistent (1): The response text is generally aligned with the reference material; however, minor discrepancies or inadequacies in detail, accuracy, or source alignment are evident.\nNot Enough Info (0): The available evidence is insufficient to substantiate or refute the claims made in the response text.\nPartially Contradictory (-1): While some aspects of the response text may align with the reference material, significant contradictions or factual inaccuracies are present.\nContradictory (-2): The response text is in direct and total opposition to the evidence presented in the ground truth.\n\nThe FEVER evaluation comprises the calculation of the percentages of responses labelled as either SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or NOT ENOUGH INFO. Meanwhile, for the CGS evaluation, a mean is calculated across all the values across every response to derive a value that ranges from -2 (totally inaccurate) to 2 (perfectly accurate). GPT-4 was leveraged for automating the evaluations against the criteria defined above, which is a consistent approach with previously published studies. Prompts for both CGS and FEVER were empirically developed and refined by iterative testing against GPT-4. In order to establish the validity of the devised evaluation metrics, 100 samples from the test dataset were sampled and inter-rater reliability was analyzed between the responses of two human evaluators and GPT-4 for both CGS and FEVER metrics."

Tables 5  ###reference_### and 5  ###reference_### show the correlation matrices analyzing the inter-rater reliability among the two independent human evaluators\u2019 (H1 and H2) scores as well as that of GPT-4, showing the utility and limitations of both CGS and FEVER within the context of factuality assessment. The CGS metric displays moderate to strong correlations, particularly with the H2 rater exhibiting a robust 0.74, suggesting a substantial concurrence with the GPT-4 evaluations. H1 demonstrated a moderate agreement with a correlation of 0.65 with GPT-4. These figures are noteworthy, given the subjective nature inherent in qualitative evaluations. The inter-rater reliability, represented by a correlation of 0.67, although not indicating perfect agreement, nevertheless reveals a meaningful consensus between the human raters that overall affirms the CGS as a reliable tool within its application scope. Contrastingly, the FEVER metric was characterized by lower correlation values and indicated a more modest agreement between evaluators \u2013 which is a reflection of the challenges faced in calibrating subjective analytical tools in general. With H1 at 0.49 and H2 at 0.6 correlation with GPT-4, there was discernible inter-evaluator consonance, albeit less pronounced than that within the CGS metric. The inter-rater correlation of 0.56, while significant, underscored the need for further evaluator calibration to mitigate interpretive disparities. Upon a deeper investigation into the divergences, the results showed that there were significant differences in the manner in which the human raters evaluated the \u2019NOT ENOUGH INFO\u2019 category with respect to each other and GPT-4, with both human raters underrating this category and preferring either the SUPPORTED or REFUTED categories instead. Thus, while the FEVER metric offers meaningful insights into the veracity of claims for the analysis in this study, its application necessitates a more critical interpretation. For the purposes of this study, CGS can be relied upon to provide a broader spectrum of consistency in evaluation, and FEVER serving as a barometer for broader factual accuracy."

All results are rank-ordered with respect to the SUPPORTED category. We first draw attention to the results of the Baseline method which represents responses from the unmodified Mistral-Instruct LLM and indicates the potential existence of any SLR-relevant prior knowledge arising from its pretraining and instruct-tuning processes, while also serving as a benchmark to determining the degree to which proposed approaches have succeeded in achieving an improvement. The baseline indicates the ability to correctly respond to 14.5% of the test data, with the majority of the responses being categorised as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\nWe see next that the NEFTune method emerged as the most effective, with 89.2% of its responses being SUPPORTED, indicative of its strong factual accuracy and alignment with the actual SLR corpus. LoRA, with an 87.7% \u2018SUPPORTED\u2018 rate, also demonstrated significant reliability, albeit marginally lower than NEFTune. In contrast, the integration of RAG with a fine-tuned dataset (RAG + FD) presents a discernible shift in distribution across all three categories, with a notable increase in \u2018NOT ENOUGH INFO\u2018 outcomes and a decrease in \u2018REFUTED\u2018 responses compared to NEFTune and LoRA. The combination of NEFTune and RAG + FD, however, exhibited a clear reduction in factual accuracy, marked by a SUPPORTED rate of 63.2%. The sharply elevated NOT ENOUGH INFO and REFUTED rates may reflect the inability of the finetuned LLM to integrate additional text from the RAG process. The low RAG (raw) outcomes underscored the challenges inherent in leveraging unmodified RAG approaches and basic methodologies in achieving accurate retrieval for the purpose of synthesis of SLR-specific information that was generated during the data extraction process.\nThe CGS results, detailed in Table 7, offer a more fine-grained perspective on the consistency of the responses. This scale ranges from -2 (Contradictory) to 2 (Fully consistent), providing a more detailed view of the alignment between the generated responses and the SLR corpus.\nSimilar to the FEVER results, in the CGS analysis NEFTune again emerged as the leader with the highest percentage of \u2019Fully consistent\u2019 responses and an overall mean score of 1.75 (87.6%), indicating a predominance in the factual fidelity of the responses. LoRA closely followed with an overall mean score of 1.72 (86.0%). The method combining RAG with a fine-tuned dataset (RAG + FD) achieved a moderately lower mean score of 1.67 (83.7%), reflecting a competent performance but with room for possible improvement via the adjustable RAG parameters, particularly in enhancing the proportion of \u2018Fully consistent\u2018 responses. NEFTune combined with RAG + FD exhibited a notable drop in performance, as evidenced by a mean score of 1.14 (57.2%), which suggests that the integration of RAG inputs with the finetuned models was likely introducing confusion in response generation. This significant decrease highlights the challenges in combining these two otherwise effective methodologies without compromising factual integrity. RAG (raw) and the baseline methods manifested the lowest consistency levels in line with previous results, with mean scores of 0.46 (23.2%) and 0.164 (8.2%) respectively."

The correlation matrix represented in Table 8 offers a refined perspective on the ordinal associations between different LLM FEVER responses. A positive k value between NEFTune and LoRA indicates a moderately similar ranking order in their response evaluations. Conversely, a near-zero k value between NEFTune and the baseline method suggests an independent performance trend, underscoring NEFTune\u2019s distinct methodological improvements over the benchmark. The correlations between responses of all other methods were not significant. Similar to the previous table, the CGS correlation Table 9 again showed a moderately positive correlation between NEFTune and LoRA (0.342), indicating that these methods share exhibited overlapping learning patterns on the underlying finetuning dataset. The near-zero correlation between NEFTune and the baseline (-0.004) reinforces the distinct advancement NEFTune contributes. This independence from the baseline method and other approaches highlights NEFTune\u2019s effectiveness in effectively encoding the finetuning dataset SLR. We next examine and compare responses of the top three best-performing approaches on two sample test questions from FEVER, showcasing an example where each method\u2019s response was classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO and REFUTED. With respect to the NOT ENOUGH INFO responses in Table LABEL:tab:FEVERNoTEnough, we find variances in detail and emphasis. In response to the question asking what manner does the dashboard contribute to the advancement of virtual learning, the reference text highlights the dashboard\u2019s role in managing lab activity schedules and resource usage on a shared AWS account, focusing on logistical aspects. In contrast, LoRA and NEFTune responses pivot towards the dashboard\u2019s educational support, emphasizing feedback, self-regulation, and progress monitoring, with NEFTune slightly touching on resource management but not to the extent mentioned in the reference. RAG + FD, while partially aligning with the reference by discussing resource usage management, also diverged by emphasizing feedback and activity completion, omitting the specific detail about scheduling. Thus, none of the responses fully encapsulated the reference\u2019s emphasis on time slot management and resource usage, illustrating a shift from logistical to educational functionalities in their interpretations. In these instances the classification of NOT ENOUGH INFO for all responses was correct. Meanwhile, with respect to the examples of REFUTED responses for the same question which requested details of a specific study\u2019s insights on how the learning analytics dashboard (LAD) drove the motivation among students in Table LABEL:tab:FEVERRefuted, we see that LoRA and NEFTune produced identical responses and closely match the reference text. However, while they correctly reported most details, they omitted the detail that intrinsic motivation actually decreased in both groups, as noted in the reference text. RAG + FD introduced a claim not present in the reference text, suggesting that LADs lead to a higher academic performance evidenced by higher final grades. Similar to LoRA and NEFTune, the response mentioned the increased extrinsic motivation in the treatment group and the lack of significant difference in changes in intrinsic motivation between the groups. However, it also omitted that intrinsic motivation decreased in both groups over time. Again, in these instances the FEVER classification of REFUTED derived by GPT-4 was correct for all responses."

            "text": "The qualitative evaluations conducted manually across the eleven NEFTune LLM responses to questions about key SLR findings in the target paper representing the ground truth, reveal a high level of fidelity and alignment between the reference and the LLM\u2019s responses. An example of a typical response can be seen in Table 14. The analysis showed that in eight out of eleven cases, the key findings from the SLR ground truth could be faithfully extracted and reconstructed from the responses provided by the finetuned LLM\u2019s responses. However, in two instances, a deeper understanding of certain domain-specific concepts such as prescriptive analytics and model interpretability within the context of learning analytics was crucial to be able to arrive at ground truth conclusions from the LLM responses. These instances highlighted a divergence in the conceptualization of certain technical terms between the LLM and the SLR study, necessitating domain expertise to align the LLM\u2019s broader interpretations with the SLR\u2019s findings. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that in 90% of the cases, the ground truth findings from the SLR study are supported by the LLM\u2019s responses. However, there was one notable LLM response that introduced some inaccuracies in its response concerning the number of participants across all the studies in 17 papers. It was only in his response that a deviation was observed and in this instance, it could be confirmed that the LLM response did not support the ground truth findings in the SLR study. Example responses from the qualitative analysis can be seen in Appendix A.\n\nThe analyses consistently demonstrate that the finetuned LLM\u2019s responses tend to provide a broader and more detailed perspective than ground truth which is often more concise and sometimes more definitive in its assertions. Below is a synthesis of the overarching patterns observed:\nExpansion and Detailing: The LLM frequently expands upon the information provided in ground truth introducing additional context, examples, and details that were not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. This pattern is evident in analyses where the LLM\u2019s responses offer a deeper dive into specific studies, technologies, and outcomes associated with LADs, enhancing the understanding of the subject matter beyond the baseline established by ground truth. However, the additional information and details are correct and do not indicate hallucination.\nAlignment with Core Assertions: Despite the additional details, the LLM\u2019s responses generally align with the core assertions or findings of ground truth. This alignment indicates that the finetuned LLM successfully captures the essence of the ground truth findings, while adding value through elaboration and exemplification.\nDiscrepancies in Emphasis and Scope: Some discrepancies arise primarily from differences in emphasis and scope. For instance, while the ground truth response might highlight a lack or absence of certain features or trends within the LADs research, the LLM occasionally points out exceptions or minor trends that counteract these broad strokes. These discrepancies do not necessarily contradict ground truth but rather suggest a more variegated picture, which can give the researcher more scope for expansion in an academic paper.\nReconstruction and Completeness: The degree to which the ground truth can be reconstructed from the LLM\u2019s responses is generally very high, reflecting the LLM\u2019s ability to both mirror and in many responses, extend the ground truth in the target paper. In cases where the LLM\u2019s detailed accounts align closely with ground truth, the reconstruction ability is high, indicating a strong corroboration of ground truth by the LLM."

            "text": "This study has marked a pivotal shift towards advancing the use of AI and LLMs for automating systematic literature review methodologies, with a particular focus on the knowledge and evidence synthesis phase. The LLM finetuning approaches and the novel data extraction processes make a novel contribution to academic research practices, with even broader applications to other domains that require syntheses across multiple documents with the requirement of supporting question and answering tasks. This study has demonstrated that indeed modern PEFT finetuning approaches like NEFTune and LoRA can be used for finetuning effective LLMs (RQ1), and the proposed automated approach for extracting finetuning datasets from a corpus of selected academic papers can successfully construct finetuning datasets (RQ2) that support question and answer downstream tasks necessary for executing the final stages of an SLR. The study also affirms that the LLMs can be effectively finetuned on relatively small datasets (RQ3) that represent relatively narrow domains associated with the focused objectives of SLR studies.\nA significant set of challenges that this study addressed and provided solutions for, concerned the broader problem of LLM hallucination and ensuring that the LLM\u2019s responses were solely based on the corpus of the selected academic papers, and how response provenance and the factuality of the responses could be evaluated (RQ4). We devised a novel token-based approach that enabled us to audit and verify the source information of the LLM responses. Meanwhile, we devised evaluation metrics for factuality and demonstrated how they can be effectively automated with the assistance of commercial LLMs for efficiency. Finally, the entire proposed framework for automating the final stages of an SLR was validated for viability by replicating an actual published SLR study, using it as a benchmark and source of ground truth. Our experiments indeed confirm the reliability of the proposed finetuning framework for its fidelity in replicating findings from an SLR study (RQ5).\nThe contributions from this study fill both an existing gap in the literature and a real need in academic research for automating SLR processes during the knowledge synthesis phase since most efforts have focused on using AI and machine learning to solve tasks such as paper searchers and filtering. While an increasing number of AI technologies are emerging to support academic research in the form of features enabling researchers to \u201ctalk to\u201d individual papers, they often have limitations and one of the key limitations is the inability to \u201ctalk across\u201d multiple papers with high reliability and the ability to track the sources of all responses. These limitations and the lack of control over the existing commercial solutions raise issues of trust as well as replicability, which this study overcomes.\nThe solutions demonstrated in this study are not without their imperfections, but future developments can overcome them. The first involves the low inter-rater consonance achieved in this study, particularly for the FEVER metric which compromised some of its validity. This will be addressed in subsequent studies through a thorough training protocol that teaches the human evaluators with more examples of how to rate responses. The data extraction process can also be improved by extracting more than just a single Q&A pair per chunk and section of each paper. This can instead be expanded to extracting multiple Q&A pairs which will have the effect of encoding more details and information from each paper, and thus have a greater chance of capturing all the important facts from each study. The quality and capability of the finetuned models is to a significant degree a function of the data extraction phase. The LLM model can only know what it has been taught. Deficiencies and omissions in the data extraction step will hinder the depth of knowledge synthesis and findings that can be supported for an SLR, therefore,\nmost gains in the quality and factuality of LLM responses stand to be gained through the improvement of this process. Likewise, the lower accuracies exhibited on the SLR-level responses can also be improved in this manner by increasing the size of this category of Q&A pairs.\nFinally, it is inevitable with the current advancements in generative AI, and LLMs specifically, that these technologies are destined to increase their role in supporting and assisting in future SLR endeavors. To that end, there is a need for revisiting and updating the PRISMA reporting guidelines. This needs to be undertaken in such a way that researchers in the future are provided with guidance on what needs to be reported when conducting PRISMA-conforming SLRs using AI automation tools in order to guarantee transparency and reproducibility. Such efforts have already begun [15  ###reference_b15###] and need to be finalised."

        "research_background": "**Motivation:**\n\nSystematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are essential for consolidating and synthesizing scholarly knowledge but are traditionally manual and resource-intensive, leading to inefficiencies. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential for automating these processes. However, generalist-trained LLMs lack domain-specific accuracy, are prone to hallucinations, and struggle with source traceability, rendering them unreliable for detailed SLR tasks.\n\n**Research Problem:**\n\nThe core problem addressed by this study is the limitations of current LLMs in automating SLRs, particularly in the phases of information retrieval and knowledge synthesis. The paper focuses on enhancing the domain-specific accuracy and reducing the hallucination propensity of LLMs to make them reliable for SLRs, ensuring that all responses can be tracked back to source studies.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\n\n1. The foundational role of SLRs in academic research and their traditional, labor-intensive nature [1-3, 7-8].\n2. The use of reporting guidelines like PRISMA to ensure the integrity of SLRs [4-6].\n3. The potential of LLMs in automating SLR processes but the challenges posed by their generalist training, hallucinations, and source traceability issues [15-23, 25-28].\n4. Existing research that acknowledges the promise of LLMs for SLRs but points out the need for significant development to overcome current limitations [27-28].",
