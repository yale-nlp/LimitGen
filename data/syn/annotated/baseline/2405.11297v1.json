    "abstract": "The latest advancements in unsupervised learning of sentence embeddings predominantly involve employing contrastive learning-based (CL-based) fine-tuning over pre-trained language models. In this study, we analyze the latest sentence embedding methods by adopting representation rank as the primary tool of analysis. We first define Phase 1 and Phase 2 of fine-tuning based on when representation rank peaks. Utilizing these phases, we conduct a thorough analysis and obtain essential findings across key aspects, including alignment and uniformity, linguistic abilities, and correlation between performance and rank. For instance, we find that the dynamics of the key aspects can undergo significant changes as fine-tuning transitions from Phase 1 to Phase 2. Based on these findings, we experiment with a rank reduction (RR) strategy that facilitates rapid and stable fine-tuning of the latest CL-based methods. Through empirical investigations, we showcase the efficacy of RR in enhancing the performance and stability of sentence embedding methods.",

            "text": "Learning sentence embeddings, which refer to the vectorized representations reflecting the semanticity of given textual inputs, is an essential task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Contrastive Learning-based (CL-based) models have emerged as predominant approaches in the field of sentence embedding (Chuang et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022b; Wu et al., 2022a; Zeng et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022a; Klein and Nabi, 2022).\n\nContrastive learning has showcased remarkable performance across various domains, including visual self-supervised learning (Chen et al., 2020) and multi-modal learning (Radford et al., 2021). Consequently, numerous studies have focused on deepening our understanding of contrastive learning. However, contrastive learning for sentence embedding is distinct in that it is employed as a fine-tuning method on a pre-trained language model. A pre-trained language model already possesses a range of natural language processing capabilities (Devlin et al., 2018; Hewitt and Manning, 2019). Therefore, fine-tuning must ensure the preservation of linguistic abilities beneficial for sentence embedding while simultaneously reducing the contrastive loss, which directly impacts the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task performance. When fine-tuning with contrastive loss, the embeddings must be adequately represented to enable cosine similarity, the predominant metric for utilizing and evaluating semantic embeddings, to serve effectively as the primary tool for semantic analysis.\n\nDespite these distinctions, most of the existing studies have primarily focused on enhancing STS performance and have provided only limited analysis directly related to their proposed methods. Recently, there has been a notable emphasis on utilizing representation rank for the analysis of deep learning models (Zhuo et al., 2023; Garrido et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023). Inspired by these recent works, we conduct an in-depth analysis of CL-based fine-tuning by thoroughly investigating representation rank and several key aspects closely related to it. Specifically, we examine uniformity and alignment, linguistic abilities, and the correlation between STS performance and rank. All these key aspects are analyzed in conjunction with Phase 1 and Phase 2 of fine-tuning, which are defined based on when representation rank peaks during the fine-tuning process. We observe and report a strong linkage with representation rank for all the key aspects.\n\nMotivated by these strong findings, we conduct experiments incorporating a rank regularization approach, specifically Rank Reduction (RR) regularizer, during the training of CL-based models. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of RR in reducing rank, leading to increased sentence embedding performance and enhanced stability. Indeed, various CL-based models have demonstrated a trend towards decreasing rank and increasing performance in their evolution, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nThis study enhances our understanding of contrastive learning-based fine-tuning of language models through representation rank analysis. Our analysis relies on defining two distinct phases of fine-tuning process, wherein key aspects can be affected in opposite manners in the two phases. We demonstrate adjusting rank is effective for performance enhancement and straightforward to implement."

            "text": "Recently, the rank of representation has been studied for many deep learning research topics, as it directly reflects the dimensionality utilized by the representation. In Jing et al. (2021), it has been observed that contrastive learning is susceptible to the phenomenon of dimensional collapse, wherein representation vectors tend to concentrate within a lower-dimensional subspace rather than spanning the entirety of the available embedding space. In Garrido et al. (2023), rank of representation is identified as a robust predictor of the downstream performance. For self-supervised learning, investigations such as those presented in Hua et al. (2021) and Kim et al. (2023) have presented findings indicating that increasing rank of a representation can contribute to the enhancement of performance in self-supervised learning. In the broader research domain of unsupervised representation learning, Zhuo et al. (2023) have revealed a phenomenon wherein the training dynamics of rank for pre-training vision tasks experience a rapid decrease followed by an increase. In contrast, we have found an opposite trend for CL-based fine-tuning, as we will elaborate in Section 3. Research on rank, as described, has predominantly occurred within the vision field and has been confined to models trained from scratch. In this study, we study rank of CL-based language models trained through fine-tuning."

We commence our analysis by visualizing fine-tuning dynamics of validation performance and representation rank. While the validation performance tends to improve with fine-tuning, representation rank increases sharply initially and then begins to decline as the fine-tuning progresses.\n\nThe fine-tuning dynamics can be evidently divided into two phases based on rank. We define Phase 1 as the initial phase that spans from the onset of training to the point where the rank reaches its maximum value. The subsequent phase, defined as Phase 2, covers the period extending beyond the conclusion of Phase 1 until the model achieves its best validation performance. It is noted that the final model is selected at the conclusion of Phase 2, commonly referred to as early stopping, even though the training continues until the pre-determined length of one epoch.\n\nBased on the two distinct phases, we explore the key aspects of fine-tuning in the following."

            "text": "Contrastive loss optimizes two distinct properties of representation (Wang and Isola, 2020): alignment and uniformity. To quantify these properties, we employ the formula introduced in Decoupled Contrastive Learning (DCL) (Yeh et al., 2022), which has been utilized for the training dynamics analysis of sentence embeddings in recent work (Nie et al., 2023).\n\nIn Figure 3, a significant improvement in uniformity is observed during Phase 1, followed by a stabilizing trend in Phase 2. Conversely, there is a significant deterioration in alignment during Phase 1, succeeded by a moderate improvement trend in Phase 2. This observation clearly indicates that the contrastive loss prioritizes enhancing uniformity over alignment during Phase 1. It suggests that BERT embeddings are initially far from being uniformly distributed, and fine-tuning focuses on improving uniformity such that the cosine similarity measure, used as the metric of sentence embedding, can function effectively. Once uniformity is sufficiently improved in Phase 1, fine-tuning transitions to Phase 2, focusing on recovering alignment while maintaining uniformity.\n\nRank is related to uniformity. For example, when the autocorrelation matrix of representation is an identity matrix, it is trivial to show that both representation rank and uniformity are maximized. Also, it can be observed in Phase 1 that the rank in Figure 2 and the uniformity loss in Figure 3 undergo steep adjustments with almost reversed shapes. This further emphasizes the strong relationship between rank and uniformity. Rank is also closely related to alignment. In Phase 2, rank exhibits a very similar trend to alignment, with both steadily returning towards their original values before fine-tuning commenced."

            "text": "The purpose of fine-tuning a language model is to leverage the language model\u2019s pre-learned linguistic abilities. However, due to the use of cosine similarity as the measure of sentence embedding, fine-tuning with contrastive loss becomes imperative. For the case of BERT, it becomes essential to enhance uniformity through fine-tuning despite the possibility of negatively affecting BERT\u2019s linguistic abilities.\n\nTo explore linguistic aspects, we followed the methodology of Conneau et al. (2018) and utilized the SentEval toolkit to investigate training dynamics of ten different linguistic abilities. Based on the observed trends in training dynamics, we grouped the ten probing tasks into three categories, as presented in Figure 4.\n\nThe first group (Figure 4(a)) consists of three tasks that exhibit deterioration in Phase 1 followed by recovery in Phase 2. They are Length (number of tokens), Depth (depth of sentence structure trees), and TopConstituents (the grammatical structure of sentences), and all three are closely related to the performance of sentence embedding. We emphasize that the worst performance occurs at or near the boundary between Phase 1 and Phase 2 for the three linguistic abilities, indicating a strong correlation with representation rank. The trend of deterioration followed by recovery was also observed for alignment, where the deterioration occurs while uniformity sharply improves.\n\nThe second group (Figure 4(b)) consists of three tasks that exhibit an upward performance trend in both Phase 1 and Phase 2. They are WordContent (deducing words from sentence representations), SubjNumber, and ObjNumber (matching the number of subjects and objects in sentence clauses, respectively), and all three are intimately related to the sentence embedding task. These three linguistic abilities do not deteriorate in Phase 1 despite uniformity\u2019s sharp improvement, suggesting that the three do not form a trade-off relationship with uniformity.\n\nThe third group (Figure 4(c)) consists of the four remaining tasks. Their performance either deteriorates (BigramShift and CoordinationInversion) or oscillates (Tense and OddManOut) throughout the fine-tuning. Compared to the other six linguistic abilities, these four are less directly associated with the sentence embedding task. For instance, changes in the order of words or clauses within a sentence are likely to have a lesser impact on the semantic information of a sentence in most common use cases of sentence embedding."

In Phase 1, the correlation between rank and performance is notably strong. This indicates that performance improves as rank increases. In Phase 2, the correlation remains strong but in a reversed manner. This suggests that performance improves as rank decreases. The robust correlation values highlight the potential for enhancing sentence embedding by controlling representation rank, a possibility that we further investigate in the following section."

Specifically, we explore phase-dependent control over STS-B development set. The investigation results are summarized in Table 1.\n\nIn the table, the single strongest trend we can observe is that promoting rank reduction in Phase 2 is significantly helpful. As evidenced by the exemplary plots provided in Figure 7 of Appendix C, rank reduction during Phase 2 facilitates rapid and stable fine-tuning, resulting in the attainment of best performance swiftly and consistently regardless of the chosen random seed. Apparently, rapid and stable fine-tuning is helpful for improving performance where rank reduction in Phase 2 promotes such a behavior.\n\nFor Phase 1, it is unclear if either rank increase or rank decrease is helpful. This can be because of the steep change in uniformity during Phase 1, where rank regularizing cannot make a steady impact.\n\nOverall, the best performance is achieved when rank is increased in Phase 1 and decreased in Phase 2. However, the best performance is marginally better than 84.13 that is obtained by decreasing rank in both Phase 1 and Phase 2.\n\nBased on the aforementioned analysis, we opt for our rank strategy, which involves reducing rank in both Phase 1 and Phase 2. This strategy simplifies the application of rank regularization as there is no need to distinguish between Phase 1 and Phase 2. Such a distinction necessitates continuous monitoring of rank during fine-tuning, which consequently incurs a computational burden. We name our strategy as RR (Rank Reduction)."

Firstly, we investigate dimensionality dependency by examining three BERT models with hidden state dimensionality of 512, 768, and 1024. Secondly, we investigate two RoBERTa models with dimensionality of 768 and 1024. In all experiments, we consistently observed a performance improvement with RR. The magnitude of improvement was contingent upon the performance of the original model. For models with high initial performance, the improvement was relatively less pronounced.

In Figure 6  ###reference_###, we are showing a scatter plot between rank and instability for the five CL-based models.

To gain deeper insights into the impact of the prompt on performance and rank, we conducted a straightforward experiment by testing four different prompts.\n\nAs anticipated, employing a simple prompt or a completely random prompt does not lead to high performance. Surprisingly, however, employing a negated prompt achieves a performance level comparable to that of the standard setups. This observation is counter-intuitive and suggests that the semantic meaning of the designed prompt alone cannot fully account for performance gains. In contrast, the representation rank consistently correlates with performance across the four cases.\n\nThe second concept concerns template denoising. We compare the performance and representation rank when denoising and Rank Reduction (RR) are applied or not during training. Removing denoising results in a decline in sentence embedding performance and a substantial increase in representation rank. Introducing RR mitigates this increase in rank and leads to improved performance. Notably, the performance improvement achieved by excluding denoising and incorporating RR is more significant than applying RR in conjunction with denoising. This suggests a potential conflict in roles, indicating that denoising may interfere with the role of rank reduction in lowering representation rank."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation:\nThe primary motivation of this paper is to deepen the understanding of contrastive learning (CL)-based fine-tuning in the context of sentence embeddings by analyzing the role of representation rank. Despite contrastive learning's demonstrated effectiveness in various domains and its recent adoption as a major approach for sentence embeddings, the authors observe that most existing studies have focused predominantly on improving Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) performance without adequate analysis of the underpinning methodologies. The paper aims to fill this gap by thoroughly investigating how representation rank during fine-tuning impacts key aspects of sentence embeddings.\n\n### Research Problem:\nThe research problem addressed by this paper is the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how CL-based fine-tuning affects sentence embeddings, particularly through the lens of representation rank. The central questions are: how does representation rank affect the uniformity and alignment of embeddings, the preservation of linguistic abilities inherent to pre-trained language models, and the correlation between representation rank and STS performance? Additionally, the paper explores how incorporating a rank regularization approach during training can stabilize and enhance embedding performance.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **Contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings**:\n   - SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021) introduced an effective unsupervised fine-tuning method for sentence embeddings using contrastive learning, inspiring subsequent work in the field.\n   - Several studies, including Chuang et al. (2022), Jiang et al. (2022b), Wu et al. (2022a), Zeng et al. (2022), and others, have expanded upon SimCSE's approach.\n\n2. **Analysis and Enhancement of CL-based Methods**:\n   - Despite the focus on enhancing STS performance, most CL-based studies have offered limited direct analysis of their methods. This work contrasts itself by focusing on a deeper analytical approach.\n\n3. **Representation Rank Analysis**:\n   - Recent work, such as Zhuo et al. (2023), Garrido et al. (2023), and Kim et al. (2023), emphasizes the importance of representation rank for analyzing deep learning models. These studies provide inspiration and a foundation for the present paper's approach.\n\nBy leveraging the understanding gained from prior works and applying a rigorous analysis of representation rank, this paper aims to contribute to the field by demonstrating the tangible benefits of rank adjustment methods like the Rank Reduction (RR) regularizer in enhancing sentence embedding performance.",

We observe that while the validation performance generally improves with fine-tuning, the representation rank initially increases sharply but then starts to decline as fine-tuning progresses.\n\nThe fine-tuning dynamics can be distinctly divided into two phases based on the representation rank.\n\n1. **Phase 1**: This initial phase spans from the start of training up to the point where the rank reaches its maximum value.\n2. **Phase 2**: The subsequent phase extends from the end of Phase 1 until the model achieves its optimal validation performance. Notably, the final model is typically selected at the end of Phase 2, a practice commonly referred to as early stopping, even though training continues until the pre-determined length of one epoch.\n\nWe further examine the key aspects of fine-tuning across these two phases. This detailed examination helps to reveal nuanced insights into the fine-tuning process, illustrating how representation ranks evolve and how they correlate with validation performance improvements.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\n**Datasets:**\nThe main experiment employed multiple datasets to assess the effectiveness of the rank regularization strategy. The specific datasets used are detailed in Appendix A and B.\n\n**Baselines:**\nThe experiment focused on enhancing the performance and stability of five state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods. These methods are:\n1. Method A\n2. Method B\n3. Method C\n4. Method D\n5. Method E\n\n(Note: The specific names of the methods are not provided in the text).\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\nThe paper did not specify the exact metrics used in the main experiment summary. However, common evaluation metrics for sentence embeddings often include measures such as:\n- Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)\n- Classification Accuracy on downstream tasks\n- Other task-specific performance metrics.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n\nThe main results illustrate that the rank regularization strategy consistently enhances both the performance and stability of the evaluated sentence embedding methods. Specific quantitative results and comparative analyses are provided in the main text and detailed in Appendix A and B.\n\nThe original wording emphasizes the consistent improvement across methods, signifying robust performance gains and greater stability due to the proposed rank regularization approach."

For Phase 1, the impact of rank change remains unclear. The best performance is observed when rank increases in Phase 1 and decreases in Phase 2, with an average performance improvement from 80.90 to 84.19. However, for practical reasons, a simplified strategy of reducing rank in both phases, named RR (Rank Reduction), is opted for.",
