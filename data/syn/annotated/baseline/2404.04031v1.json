    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive computational study of the under-investigated phenomenon of personal name compounds (PNCs) in German such as Willkommens-Merkel (\u2018Welcome-Merkel\u2019). Prevalent in news, social media, and political discourse, PNCs are hypothesized to exhibit an evaluative function that is reflected in a more positive or negative perception as compared to the respective personal full name (such as Angela Merkel). We model 321 PNCs and their corresponding full names at discourse level, and show that PNCs bear an evaluative nature that can be captured through a variety of computational methods. We further enrich our data with personal, domain-specific, and extra-linguistic information and perform a range of regression analyses revealing that factors including compound and modifier valence, domain, and political party membership influence how a PNC is evaluated. \n\nKeywords:\u2009Multiword Expressions & Collocations, Semantics, Statistical and Machine Learning Models",

            "text": "Personal name compounds (PNCs) such as Willkommens-Merkel (\u2018Welcome-Merkel\u2019), Chaos-Johnson (\u2018Chaos-Johnson\u2019) and Tore-Klose (\u2018Goal-Klose\u2019) are nominal compounds that consist of a modifier such as Willkommen (\u2018Welcome\u2019) and a personal name such as Merkel. PNCs are compositions that refer to a person, in our example the former German chancellor Angela Merkel. With few exceptions Wildgen (1981  ###reference_b36###); K\u00fcrschner (2020  ###reference_b19###), PNCs have not received much attention from the theoretical or computational perspectives, but recent work suggests that they represent a rather frequent phenomenon and carry an evaluative function with regard to the reference person Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###); Belosevic (2022  ###reference_b3###). That is, for a specific PNC in its discourse, we hypothesize that the PNC is perceived as either more positively or as more negatively than the corresponding full name. For understanding and generating texts from and for domains where real-world people are talked about (such as the news, social media, and any kind of political discourse, as well as for related tasks including sentiment and emotion analysis) it is thus particularly relevant to explore the evaluative nature and discourse effects of PNCs. This paper performs such an investigation: we leverage and extend an existing dataset consisting of German PNCs and their corresponding full names from the domains politics, sports, show business, and others Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###). To assess PNCs in their contexts, we build a corpus drawing on data from social media (Twitter) and German news (Deutscher Wortschatz). We then draw on the notion of valence from psycholinguistics that determines the pleasantness of a stimulus. Valence is considered one of the principal dimensions of affect and cognitive heuristics that shape human bias and attitude Harmon-Jones et al. (2013  ###reference_b14###). It determines the affective quality referring to the intrinsic pleasantness or unpleasantness of a stimulus (e.g., joy vs. toothache) Osgood et al. (1957  ###reference_b26###); Frijda (1986  ###reference_b10###). We hypothesize that PNCs with a higher or lower valence relative to their respective full name bear an evaluative character. To assess valence at the context level, we develop a computational approach. Since PNC meaning is heavily dependent on modifier meaning, we also examine to which extent modifier valence influences the evaluation of the whole compound. Lastly, we explore whether personal background information such as age, domain-specific knowledge and extra-linguistics information impact the PNC evaluation. To explore which factors are influential at a statistically significant level, we fit a range of regression models. Our results show that PNCs are both positively and negatively evaluative in comparison to their full name with a tendency towards a negative evaluative nature, underlining previous findings from Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###); Belosevic (2022  ###reference_b3###). We find domain-specific differences with public figures from the domain politics bearing a more negative meaning, while the opposite is true for PNCs from the domain sports and show business. Modeling modifiers reveals corresponding valence scores to be more extreme than valence scores obtained for the compound as a whole with a tendency towards lower valence. Our findings also highlight cases where modifier meaning is either interpreted non-literally or smoothed down when evaluated as a PNC constituent. Finally, while personal and domain-specific information impact the evaluative nature of a PNC, regression models including extra-linguistic information such as compound valence are more informative. Our best model thus combines information from all variables except name valence, with factors such as compound valence, domain, and political party membership playing an important role."

            "text": "PNCs such as Tore-Klose (\u2018Goal-Klose\u2019) are nominal compounds that consist of a modifier which is usually realized in form of appellative or onymic constituents (e.g., Tore) and a head constituent that is filled with a first, last, or nick name (Klose) Belosevic (2022  ###reference_b3###).\nPNCs are formed based on regular patterns within a context that both evaluates and evokes knowledge regarding the name bearer Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###). For example, the PNC Tore-Klose (\u2019Goal Klose\u2019) refers to the former German soccer player Miroslav Klose who is the all-time top scorer for Germany with 16 goals scored during the Men\u2019s FIFA World Cup. The example also illustrates the importance of the compound modifier contributing information regarding the name bearer or events in which the name bearer was involved. In other words, the meaning of the modifier is the reason or at least related to the reason why this compound was formed. In our example, goal hints towards a positive evaluation of the PNC as such an event is usually connected with particular athletic performance and special occasions, as well as concrete events such as scored goals during the soccer world cup in 2014."

            "text": "German PNCs are under-investigated from both a theoretical and computational point of view. Early work is limited to very small scale studies based on a few names Wildgen (1981  ###reference_b36###) or focus on other phenomena and touch on this composition type only in passing K\u00fcrschner (2020  ###reference_b19###); Ortner and Ortner (1984  ###reference_b24###); Ortner and M\u00fcller-Bollhagen (1991  ###reference_b25###); Schl\u00fccker (2017  ###reference_b30###, 2020  ###reference_b31###). An exception is recent work by Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###) who present a systematic analysis of ~1.2K PNCs to test three hypotheses on personal name composition that prevail in word formation (irregularity or unpredictability, low frequency, evaluative function). They compile a small Twitter and newspaper corpus, manually infer a paraphrase of the PNC in form of a relative clause, and assign a corresponding German FrameNet  ###reference_gsw.phil.hhu.de/### Ziem (2014  ###reference_b39###) relation. Their corpus analysis shows that not only are PNCs formed based on regular patterns but also bear an evaluative and a knowledge-evoking function.\nWhile this analysis constitutes an important contribution to name-based composition and evaluation, it is, however, limited by size and a manual approach.\nFrom a NLP perspective, PNCs have not received much attention yet. Related tasks such as noun compound interpretation where a noun compound is classified into a predefined label or expressed in a paraphrase Lauer (1995  ###reference_b20###); Kim and Baldwin (2005  ###reference_b16###); Shwartz and Dagan (2018  ###reference_b34###); Coil and Shwartz (2023  ###reference_b6###) and noun compound conceptualization exploring rare or novel interpretation through paraphrasing Dhar et al. (2019  ###reference_b7###); Li et al. (2022  ###reference_b21###) neither include PNCs nor approaches to assess the evaluative function of such compounds.\nAnother relevant line of work concentrates on sentiment analysis (SA), i.e., predicting the sentiment, attitude or opinion of text or speech on different units using e.g., the categories positive, neutral and negative Mohammad (2012  ###reference_b23###).\nWillkommens-Merkel\n(\u2018Welcome-Merkel\u2019)\n#Lanz This political constellation should never have come about in the first place, says Merz.

We hypothesize that PNCs with higher or lower valence relative to their respective full name bear an evaluative character. For this, PNC and full name valence are assessed and compared at context level both cross and within domains. We further determine PNC modifier valence and explore the relationship between PNC and modifier evaluation. \n\nWe apply part-of-speech (PoS) tagging including lemmatization to all context words of a given target. We only keep context lemmas which belong to the word classes noun, adjective, or verb. \n\nOur findings are visualized including PNC frequency illustrated by increasing dot size. PNCs are sorted by name valence with the lowest valence score determined for the German businessman, arms dealer, and lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber, and the highest valence score calculated for the former German soccer player Bastian Schweinsteiger. We note that PNC valence moves more towards the name valence line in case of higher frequencies, while outlier PNC scores tend to be more distanced. Across domains, we find PNCs bearing a slightly more negative nature than full names with PNC valence distributed over a greater score range. More specifically, 56% of PNCs are shown to be more negatively evaluative than the corresponding full names.\n\nTo gain qualitative insights, we inspect the sample name-PNC pairs with the largest positive and negative relative differences and examine the most frequent context words. The greatest positive comes from the PNC Tore-Klose (\u2018Goal-Klose\u2019) which refers to the former German soccer player Miroslav Klose. While name valence is around average, the PNC is evaluated very positively. Frequent context words of both PNC and name are on average positive since Klose was a very successful athlete, known for his fair play, and well-received in the public sphere. However, considering that the PNC Tore-Klose refers to the specific positive event of scoring many goals, the PNC is evaluated even more positively, with frequent context words such as feiern (\u2018celebrate\u2019), herrlich (\u2018wonderful\u2019), and gold (\u2018gold\u2019) pointing at this finding.\n\nWhen looking at the pair with the greatest negative difference, we find the PNC Knast-Hoene\u00df (\u2018Prison-Hoene\u00df\u2019). While Ulrich Hoene\u00df is also a successful former German soccer player, he is now mainly known for the fact that he was found guilty of serious cases of tax evasion. However, frequent context words are mixed, including the modifier Knast (\u2018prison\u2019), sagen (\u2018to say\u2019), and Jahr (\u2018year\u2019). An explanation for this might be that the public credits Hoene\u00df for accepting the guilty verdict without appeal.\n\nWe further compare results within domains. As shown, PNC valence scores extend both below and above name valence for the domains politics and sports, while exceeding name valence only for others. Both PNC and name valence scores are lowest for public figures from politics, followed by the slightly more positively evaluated domain others. Athletes, in contrast, are generally evaluated more positively, surpassing the mean value of 5 for both PNC and name valence.\n\nWe find modifier valence to be spread across a substantially wider range than PNC valence. In comparison, PNC valence values range, with average PNC valence and average modifier valence. The majority of modifiers is located below PNC valence with modifier valence increasing only slightly with higher PNC valence.\n\nFor more fine-grained insights, we examine the modifier-PNC pairs with the largest positive and negative difference. Investigating the largest positive leads us to the PNC Willkommens-Merkel (\u2018Welcome-Merkel\u2019). Inspecting frequent context words such as Abschiebung (\u2018deportation\u2019), verheerend (\u2018devastating\u2019), and Kritik (\u2018criticism\u2019) reveals quite negative discourses. This might indicate potentially ironic use of the modifier welcome as the context words convey the opposite meaning or a negative stance towards corresponding political actions of the name bearer.\n\nThe modifier-PNC pair Enteignungs-K\u00fchnert (\u2018Expropriation-K\u00fchnert\u2019) is the PNC with the largest negative. Here, modifier valence is extremely low, while PNC valence is around average. Context words are very mixed w.r.t. valence, including mentions of Partei (\u2018political party\u2019), Wahl (\u2018election\u2019), and Wohnung (\u2018apartment\u2019). Thus, the extreme value of the modifier is not reflected by the context words and, consequently, PNC valence."

            "text": "We explore the evaluative function of PNCs using pretrained language models (PLMs) fine-tuned for sentiment analysis (SA). Our hypothesis is that PNCs with more positive or negative sentiment compared to their full names indicate an evaluative character. We frame this as a text classification problem, analyzing the context of PNCs or names to obtain predictions that are mapped onto a valence scale. This allows us to determine evaluative differences between PNCs and full names.\n\nWe utilize the model GBERT-Migration, which is a fine-tuned version of a sentiment analysis model for German, focusing on news articles about migration. Sentiment classification labels include negative, neutral, and positive, and computations derive a weighted valence score for each target. This score is based on the distribution of sentiment labels, weighing positive differently from neutral to account for nuanced evaluative meanings.\n\nOur findings indicate that PNCs often carry a more negative evaluative function than full names. However, comprehensive results suggest variability in predictions, with human evaluations generally indicating a more substantial negative interpretation of PNCs than computational approaches.\n\nWe conducted a human evaluation, testing 30 PNCs, and found instances where annotators\u2019 perceptions diverged from computational predictions. Annotators expressed difficulty in labeling sentiment accurately, a factor that reflects the complexity of the task. Human annotations suggest a consistent pattern: PNCs within domains like sports are evaluated more positively than those in politics.\n\nThese findings emphasize that although PLM-based sentiment predictions can estimate whether PNCs are more evaluative than full names, human evaluations often reveal different nuances. Further investigation could focus on specific target sentiment prediction and enhancing model comprehension of overarching discourses. This would help refine the application of PLMs to sentiment analysis in a way that aligns more closely with human interpretation."

        "research_background": "### Motivation:\nThe paper is motivated by the need to understand and generate texts in domains where real-world people are frequently mentioned, such as news, social media, and political discourse. The focus is on personal name compounds (PNCs) in the German language, like \"Willkommens-Merkel,\" \"Chaos-Johnson,\" and \"Tore-Klose,\" which combine a modifier with a personal name to create a nominal compound. These PNCs have been observed to carry an evaluative function, meaning they are perceived more positively or negatively compared to the full name of the person referenced. Understanding the evaluative nature of PNCs is particularly relevant for tasks like sentiment and emotion analysis.\n\n### Research Problem:\nThe primary research problem addressed in the paper is to systematically investigate the evaluative nature and discourse effects of German PNCs. This involves understanding how PNCs are perceived in comparison to the full names they abbreviate and identifying whether they tend to carry more positive or negative sentiment. Furthermore, the paper seeks to explore how the valence (pleasantness) of the modifiers and personal background information affect the overall evaluation of these compounds.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **Wildgen (1981) and K\u00fcrschner (2020)**: These works are among the few exceptions that have theoretically examined PNCs, although the attention given to this linguistic phenomenon has been sparse.\n   \n2. **Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021), Belosevic (2022)**: These studies suggest that PNCs are fairly common and carry evaluative meanings regarding the person they refer to, indicating that PNCs tend to be perceived either more positively or negatively compared to their corresponding full names.\n\n3. **Harmon-Jones et al. (2013), Osgood et al. (1957), Frijda (1986)**: These works contribute to the understanding of valence from psycholinguistics, proposing valence as a principal dimension of affect and cognitive heuristics that determine the pleasantness or unpleasantness of a stimulus.\n\n4. **Barbieri et al. (2022), Antypas et al. (2023), Guhr et al. (2020), L\u00fcdke et al. (2022)**: These studies present various approaches and evaluations of sentiment analysis using pretrained language models (PLMs), which this paper leverages to interpret and evaluate the sentiment of PNCs.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology Summary:\n\nThe proposed method aims to explore and model the evaluative meaning of German Personal Name Compounds (PNCs) by examining their valence, which measures the pleasantness of a stimulus.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **Hypothesis:**\n   - PNCs that deviate in valence from their corresponding full names carry an evaluative character.\n\n2. **Valence Assessment:**\n   - Valence scores are automatically generated using the norms provided by K\u00f6per and Schulte im Walde (2016).\n   - Ratings range from 0 (low valence) to 10 (high valence).\n\n3. **Context Analysis:**\n   - Context words of each target name and PNC are tagged for part-of-speech (PoS) using TreeTagger for reliability.\n   - Lemmas from nouns, adjectives, and verbs are retained and assigned valence scores if available in the norms.\n\n4. **Valence Calculation:**\n   - Valence for a target is defined by the normalized mean valence of corresponding context lemmas.\n   - Comparison of PNCs and corresponding full names involves calculating the valence delta.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis:**\n   - The valence delta across and within domains (politics, sports, and others) is statistically analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n6. **Findings Visualization:**\n   - Findings are visualized, highlighting frequency and deviations.\n   - PNC and name valence distributions are compared across domains.\n\n7. **Qualitative Insights:**\n   - Sample pairs with the largest positive and negative valence differences are inspected.\n   - Context words' analysis provides deeper insights into specific PNC evaluations.\n\n**Key Innovations and Insights:**\n\n1. **Application of Valence Norms:**\n   - Leveraging automatically generated valence norms for evaluating PNCs.\n   - Incorporating normalized mean valence for comprehensive measurement.\n\n2. **Domain-Specific Analysis:**\n   - PNCs generally showed a more negative nature than full names, with 56% of PNCs more negatively evaluative.\n\n3. **Frequency Impact:**\n   - PNC valence aligns closer to name valence with higher frequencies; outliers are more distanced.\n\n4. **Modifier-Valence Relationship:**\n   - PNC modifiers exhibit a broader valence range than PNCs.\n   - Examining pairs with extreme valence provides context insights, e.g., Willkommens-Merkel ('Welcome-Merkel') with peak modifier valence but negative context-driven PNC valence.\n\n5. **Qualitative Context Adjustments:**\n   - The findings indicate potential ironies or complex social perceptions in PNC evaluations, influenced by context words.\n\nBy intertwining psycholinguistic valence norms with sophisticated statistical and qualitative analyses within specific domains, the method offers a nuanced understanding of the evaluative nature of German PNCs.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\nThe main experiment utilizes 770 eventive Personal Name Compounds (PNCs) extracted from various sources, including DWDS and Twitter. The PNCs are filtered and grouped based on their context, ending with 321 instances with at least one context and 217 instances with at least five contexts for modeling. \n\n**Datasets:**\n1. **DWDS and Twitter Corpora:**\n   - **PNCs:** The dataset consists of PNCs, mostly in the domains of politics (87%), sports (9%), show business (1%), and others (3%).  \n   - **Full Names:** Each PNC was mapped to its corresponding full name (first and last names), leading to 131 and 113 names associated with at least one and five PNC instances, respectively. \n   - **Tweets:** The dataset comprised 9,145 tweets containing a PNC and 24,688 tweets containing a full name.\n   - **News Data:** Additionally, the Leipzig Corpora Collection provided news data amounting to ~27 million sentences, including 170 sentences containing a PNC and 233,477 sentences containing a full name.\n\n**Baselines:**\n- The experiment does not explicitly mention baselines for comparison within the provided section. \n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\n- The metrics for evaluating the experiment are not specified within the excerpt, but the evaluation likely hinges on the contextual and frequency-based characteristics of PNCs and their corresponding full names.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n\nThe main experiment\u2019s outcome includes the frequency and contextual distribution of PNCs and their corresponding full names:\n- **Tweets:** 9,145 tweets with PNCs and 24,688 tweets with full names were collected.\n- **News Sentences:** 170 sentences containing PNCs and 233,477 containing full names were retrieved from the Leipzig Corpora Collection.\n\nThe experimental results are primarily descriptive, as the section provided does not detail specific quantitative or qualitative evaluation results beyond the data corpus sizes and distributions.\n\n### Notes:\n- The experiment aims to explore the evaluative meanings of German PNCs within different textual contexts.\n- The descriptive results focus on highlighting the domains and frequency distributions of PNCs, paving the way for detailed analysis in subsequent sections of the paper."
