    "title": "SoftTiger: A Clinical Foundation Model for Healthcare Workflows",
    "abstract": "We introduce SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM) designed as a foundation model for healthcare workflows. The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression, and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.",

            "text": "The healthcare sector is currently grappling with an unprecedented level of demand and critical challenges. In an ideal setting, physicians would require an unfeasible 26 hours per day to adhere to all care protocols, underscoring their extreme work pressure (Porter et al. 2022). This scenario is compounded by the fact that nearly half of a physician's time is devoted to digital paperwork, rather than direct patient care (Sinsky et al. 2016). The intensive workload has led to a disturbing increasing trend: 50.4% of physicians reported burnout, in a large cohort and longitudinal study (Ortega et al. 2023) across many specialties. Moreover, this overburden of healthcare professionals has dire consequences for patient safety. Nearly 800,000 patients annually in the United States (US) are harmed by diagnostic errors. Most of these are associated with cognitive mistakes, according to a recent study from Johns Hopkins (Newman-Toker et al. 2024), escalating medical errors as the third leading cause of death in the US (Makary and Daniel 2016). This scenario is already dramatic by itself, but it would be worsened by the predicted shortfall of the health workforce (HWF) of 18 million health workers by 2030 (Boniol et al. 2022), highlighting the critical need for systemic changes in the healthcare industry.\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs), both proprietary models, like GPT (Brown et al. 2020) and Gemini (Pichai 2023), have shown significant potential in processing and analyzing clinical notes (Kweon et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023b). However, integrating them into clinical practice poses two primary challenges. The first pertains to the helpfulness of AI-powered clinical tasks, such as clinical note question answering (Kweon et al. 2023). These tasks, while functionally important, must also be designed and implemented seamlessly with both electronic health records (EHRs) and the clinical steps of patient care to avoid workflow fragmentation (Moy et al. 2023). To understand the potential for enhancing workflows, we conducted a survey of various clinical downstream tasks, from associated research papers from arXiv and AI models in Hugging Face, including clinical language models (CLaMs) and foundation models for electronic medical records (FEMRs) (Wornow et al. 2023). We asked domain experts to provide ratings on a Fibonacci scale for the complexity and helpfulness of reported tasks, with results as shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe second challenge is associated with the input length constraints of LLMs. Most popular LLMs were trained using a 4k-token context window, which is sufficient for most general-purpose tasks. An annotated sample of 620 clinical notes drawn from MIMIC IV (Johnson et al. 2023) shows that 75% exceeds 2k and 38% is above 4k tokens, a Gaussian-like distribution very different from other daily tasks (usually follows a power law). Therefore, it is imperative for clinical LLMs to be able to be efficiently trained on a context window of up to 8k tokens or more, instead of relying on length extrapolation during inference, which we found in our experiments would lose resolution drastically.\n\nIn this work, we strategically focused on the tasks of patient clinical data structuring, a crucial yet intricate component of clinical workflows. A large published review shows that almost 80% of medical data is unstructured (A.Maria Nancy 2020), hampering the efficient development of more intelligent models. We choose these tasks, both moderately complex and highly valuable in our comprehensive analysis of the clinical domain, not only due to their practical significance but also considering the status quo of LLMs, particularly their superb capabilities exhibited in structural extraction and natural language instruction following. We present SoftTiger, a clinical LLM suitable for both basic tasks such as named entity recognition, summarization, and question answering, but also for more complex and foundational workflow tasks of clinical data structuring.\n\nOur approach is seamless and lightweight, embarking from a state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose LLM, taking about 20 thousand dollars of GPU hours and a week to develop. The compute economics we deem is critical for rapid experimentation and adoption in the healthcare domain. Overall, we have made the following contributions:\n\nWe publicly release a family of clinical LLMs, SoftTiger, at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, achieving SOTA performance in clinical note processing compared with other popular open and closed-source LLMs.\n\nWe develop a stack of algorithmic and infrastructural implementations, not only fast adapting LLMs to the clinical domain but also addressing challenges specific to the domain, including training long context and medical jargon understanding and abbreviation expansion.\n\nWe also open-source release our"

In this first release, we aligned and optimized the model for three distinct subtasks, each focusing on a different aspect of patient information and interaction with the healthcare system. The aim is to facilitate better healthcare planning and efficient patient care through comprehensive and organized clinical documentation. The three subtasks are as follows:\n\nPatient Clinical Summary (FHIR IPS): This subtask involves creating a comprehensive summary of the patient\u2019s social and clinical history. It includes detailing the patient\u2019s background, lifestyle choices, past illnesses, and family medical history. The objective is to provide a complete overview of the patient\u2019s medical and personal background, which is crucial for informed healthcare planning and decision-making.\n\nClinical Impression (FHIR Clinical Impression): The focus of this subtask is to summarize objective information gathered from various patient examinations. This includes documenting findings from imaging studies, laboratory test results, and other diagnostic procedures. The goal is to efficiently compile and review the patient\u2019s diagnostic data, aiding in the formulation of accurate clinical impressions and treatment plans.\n\nMedical Encounter (FHIR Encounter): This subtask aims to systematically document the key elements of each patient-physician interaction. Essential details such as the location of the encounter, participants involved, and the reasons for the encounter are to be recorded. The purpose is to streamline the clinical documentation process, ensuring a clear and concise record of patient visits and the medical team\u2019s involvement.\n\nBy completing these subtasks, healthcare professionals can ensure thorough and efficient clinical documentation for every step, which is essential for quality patient care and effective healthcare management."

            "text": "SoftTiger models are supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on general-purpose open-source foundation LLMs. Our choice of the foundation model is based upon several design considerations. First, the model has a good representativeness of biomedical vocabulary. The arXiv dataset has 1.2% biomedical related subjects, which we deem lays us a good foundation knowledge for healthcare domain. Second, the foundation model should have grasped general-purpose tasks such as summarization, extraction, and question answering, with good instruction-following capabilities. For this, we choose chat models instead of pre-trained ones. Building a clinical LLM is essentially a domain adaptation process, which should be lightweight. Also, the clinical domain data is mostly one order of magnitude smaller than general fine-tuning data. Third, it is beneficial for world-wide adoption to build multilingual models with a range of parameter sizes.\n\nTo empirically validate our choice, we collected a sample of 100 curated clinical notes from MIMIC IV, and then used Azure OpenAI GPT-4 to simulate three subtasks of patient clinical data structuring, to form a validation dataset of 300 examples. \n\nBoth foundation models were trained on 4k context length, without domain data fine-tuning."

            "text": "Our training data consists of 134 million tokens, or 313k instruction completion examples and 489M plaintext data in the JSON format: {\"instruction\":..., \"output\":...}. For the clinical domain data, the \"instruction\" prompt is composed of input clinical note concatenated with task instruction, while the \"output\" is structural extraction. Input clinical notes were drawn from the MIMIC IV dataset. The three output task extractions were first synthesized from Azure OpenAI GPT-4, and then corrected for quality and safety by a group of 5 physicians during one week. They received an annotation manual and two-hour remote training in the task domain. Also, they followed an annotation workflow to balance workload.\n\nThe histogram of data lengths in tokens is shown in Figure 3. Other than output length, both input and total length of examples follow a Gaussian-like distribution, with a major chunk beyond 2k. The use of medical term abbreviation is a norm in clinical notes. We employ a dictionary of abbreviation expansion to standardize abbreviations both for training and inference runtime.\n\nSince we formulate the clinical LLM building as a domain specialization problem, we mix in two layers of data other than the domain data for the task of patient summarization. First, a new sample of general-purpose SFT data was drawn from a previously unseen corpus. This layer is for experience replay (Sun et al. 2020) for general tasks such as generation, summarization, question answering, and so forth. Second, we add the Asclepius dataset (Kweon et al. 2023) for basic functional tasks in the clinical domain, such as named entity recognition, abbreviation expansion, and paraphrasing, etc. The detailed training data mix is illustrated in Table 3. We organize the training data in an order from general, domain, to task specific. The trainer scans the data sequentially within one epoch, following the human learning process of domain specialization."

First, we used an evaluation dataset of 300 examples, with 100 clinical notes sampled from MIMIC IV and three task completions for each executed by Azure OpenAI GPT-4.

SoftTiger models outperform for both model sizes and evaluation context lengths. SoftTiger-70b model surpasses 13b by a small margin, possibly because the task-specific training data is still small in volume and the learning is still on the monotonically increasing trajectory.\n\nSecondly, we implemented a ChatBot Arena with LLM-as-a-Judge using Azure OpenAI GPT-4. We followed blind pairwise evaluation method (ModelA vs ModelB), with swap-position executions to prevent positional bias (changed positions with different results are discarded). Study shows average of 85% of agreement with humans using GPT-4 (Zheng et al. 2023). The arena dataset consists of 100 answers for the Patient Clinical Summary task by popular both closed and open-source LLM models. We also designed a control group model, with intentionally wrong information. We determined the intelligence inspired chess ELO rating (initial rating=1000, k=30) as in Table 5, with some illustrations of SoftTiger and implementation details of the blind test shown in Appendices.\n\nThis cost-effective evaluation method rapidly enables iterative experimentation and optimization at scale, allowing further optimized human alignment with healthcare professionals. Reasonable results of bigger closed models as higher ELO, but optimized SoftTiger-70b near Gemini-pro. Lightweight and cost-effective SoftTiger-13b model also showing feasibility for deployment."

Giving them this level of structure and summary helps to alleviate the cognitive pressure and the dramatic situation of healthcare delivery overburden. \n\nWe leveraged LLM\u2019s excellent capabilities of structural extraction and natural language interaction to achieve satisfactory results, using innovative rapid experimentation and evaluation methods. However, the statistical nature of LLMs still incurs hallucination issues, which is particularly risky in the medical domain and demands more work towards model alignment. Our future works plan to tackle the hallucination problem using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with expert-curated knowledge graphs with biomedical terminologies. We also plan to explore specially designed reinforcement learning algorithms to increase model intelligence and execute the first real cases of clinical workflows integration experiments."

These models have demonstrated impressive abilities in language understanding, generation, and various downstream tasks. However, the evaluation of these models across different criteria remains a challenging task. In this study, we aim to benchmark several state-of-the-art language models using a comprehensive evaluation framework.\n\n2. Evaluation Framework\n\nWe employed a multi-faceted evaluation framework to assess the performance of large language models. This framework includes metrics such as linguistic proficiency, knowledge retrieval, reasoning ability, contextual understanding, and creative generation. To ensure a robust and fair comparison, we used both automated metrics and human evaluations across diverse datasets.\n\n3. Experiment Setup\n\nFor the experiments, we utilized two primary datasets covering a wide range of linguistic and knowledge-based challenges. The first dataset focuses on general language tasks, including text completion and question answering, while the second dataset targets more specific domains like technical knowledge and creative writing.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\n\nThe results of our evaluations are summarized as follows:\n\n- **Linguistic Proficiency**: The evaluated models performed well across standard language tasks, showcasing their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. The fluency and grammaticality of the outputs were rated highly in the human evaluations.\n\n- **Knowledge Retrieval**: In terms of knowledge-based tasks, the models successfully extracted relevant information, though performance varied depending on the specificity and complexity of the query. Models demonstrated proficiency in general knowledge domains.\n\n- **Reasoning Ability**: There was a noticeable difference in the models' reasoning capabilities. While some models excelled in logical reasoning tasks, others showed room for improvement, particularly in understanding nuanced contextual cues.\n\n- **Contextual Understanding**: When it came to context awareness, the models generally performed well, maintaining coherence and relevance throughout longer text sequences.\n\n- **Creative Generation**: Creativity in text generation varied among the models. Some produced imaginative and novel content, while others leaned towards more predictable outputs.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe benchmarking of large language models through a comprehensive evaluation framework allows for a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. While the models exhibit strong language and knowledge retrieval capabilities, there remains scope for enhancing reasoning and creativity in language generation. Future research could focus on improving these aspects to further advance the field of NLP."

            "text": "In the development and deployment of SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM), we have rigorously adhered to ethical guidelines and best practices to ensure the responsible use of technology in healthcare. We recognize the sensitive nature of clinical data and the critical importance of maintaining patient privacy and safety. This statement outlines the ethical considerations we have taken into account and the steps we have taken to ensure the reproducibility of our research and work.\nData Privacy and Confidentiality: All patient data used in training SoftTiger were sampled from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) dataset, already complying with patient data de-identification and safety cleaning.\nData Responsible Use: According to PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data License 1.5.0  777Web: https://physionet.org/about/licenses/physionet-credentialed-health-data-license-150/, and Physionet Responsible use of MIMIC data with online services like GPT  888Web: https://physionet.org/news/post/gpt-responsible-use, Azure OPENAI Service and AWS Bedrock were used to process data. The data and code of this work is also available under Physionet terms and repository.\nBias and Fairness: We acknowledge the potential for inherent biases in AI models. To mitigate this, in the evaluation method of ChatBot-Arena we took the conservative approach of repeating the evaluations twice while switching positions and only considering agreed results. The evaluation was blind sided, also with a control group to detect deviations from judgment. We also randomly sampled data in large MIMIC datasets considering mixed sized and complexity distributions in inputs.\nTransparency and Openness: In line with promoting reproducibility, we have made SoftTiger\u2019s datasets, training data, and model parameters publicly available. All the prompts used and results, including all of the code necessary to generate, expand and recreate the datasets are open-source. All the prompts, data and code to reproduce the ChatbotArena evaluation are also available.\nSafety and Reliability: A core design principle of SoftTiger responsible AI development.For this, we included helpfulness and harmfulness of the models as a core criteria of every evaluation, and warn everyone using our work to further align any real world clinical use first with a human-eval of healthcare professionals considered as a last step of model alignment, then with a Ethics Board Approval of the healthcare institution.\nOngoing Monitoring and Improvement: Recognizing that AI in healthcare is an evolving field, we commit to continuous monitoring of SoftTiger\u2019s performance and making iterative improvements to address emerging issues or changes in clinical practices.\nCompliance with Regulatory Standards: Our development process and model deployment are in compliance with relevant healthcare regulations and standards, ensuring that SoftTiger aligns with legal and ethical requirements. This was particularly considered in the format of the clinical downstream tasks, by selecting the International Patient Summary (IPS) and HL7 FHIR entities (Clinical Impression, Medical Encounter)\nCollaboration with Healthcare Professionals: Throughout development and deployment, we have actively collaborated with healthcare professionals to ensure that SoftTiger meets the practical needs of the healthcare industry and aligns with clinical workflows."

This decision is grounded in the fact that our work primarily involved the use of de-identified, publicly or credentialed available data and did not directly engage with human subjects or patient-specific data in a clinical setting.\nHowever, we strongly advise that any derivative works, extensions, or real-world clinical implementations of SoftTiger undergo thorough ethical review and obtain necessary approvals. This is particularly crucial when such projects involve:\nThe use of personally identifiable patient data or engagement with human subjects.\nImplementation in clinical settings where decisions may directly affect patient care and outcomes.\nAny form of clinical trial or research that involves human participants.\nWe emphasize the importance of responsible clinical alignment, ensuring that any use of SoftTiger or its derivatives aligns with ethical standards, respects patient privacy and confidentiality, and adheres to all applicable regulations and guidelines. This approach is vital for maintaining public trust and ensuring the responsible use of AI in healthcare."

        "research_background": "**Motivation:**\nThe paper addresses critical challenges faced by the healthcare sector, such as extreme physician work pressure, time constraints, physician burnout, and patient safety concerns caused by diagnostic errors. These issues are exacerbated by the anticipated shortfall of healthcare workers, emphasizing an urgent need for systemic changes within the industry. Additionally, a large portion of medical data is unstructured, posing a significant barrier to developing more intelligent healthcare models.\n\n**Research Problem:**\nThe research primarily seeks to address two core issues with integrating large language models (LLMs) into clinical practice:\n1. Ensuring the helpfulness of AI-powered clinical tasks, such as clinical note question answering, and integrating these tasks seamlessly with electronic health records (EHRs) to avoid workflow fragmentation.\n2. Overcoming the input length constraints of current LLMs, which are insufficient for handling the extensive and diverse nature of clinical notes, thus necessitating the ability for LLMs to efficiently handle longer context windows.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\nThe paper builds on and acknowledges significant prior contributions in several domains:\n1. *Workload Challenges in Healthcare* - Porter et al. (2022) highlight the unrealistic demands placed on physicians; Sinsky et al. (2016) discuss the time devoted to digital paperwork over direct patient care; Ortega et al. (2023) report on physician burnout; Newman-Toker et al. (2024) illustrate the impact of diagnostic errors on patient safety.\n2. *Shortage of Healthcare Workers* - Boniol et al. (2022) predict a drastic shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030.\n3. *Advancements in LLMs* - Pioneering models like GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Gemini (Pichai 2023), Llama-2 (Touvron et al. 2023), and TigerBot (Chen et al. 2023a) demonstrate the potential of LLMs in clinical settings. Specific studies such as Kweon et al. (2023) and Chen et al. (2023b) examine the application of LLMs in processing clinical notes.\n4. *Challenges with LLM Integration* - Moy et al. (2023) discuss the critical need to integrate AI tasks without disrupting clinical workflows.\n5. *Context Window Limitations* - Analysis and results from Johnson et al. (2023) show the input length constraints of current LLMs.\n6. *Unstructured Medical Data* - A. Maria Nancy (2020) highlights that a majority of medical data remains unstructured, which hinders the development of intelligent models.\n\nThe paper aims to leverage these insights and build upon existing LLM capabilities to develop SoftTiger, a foundation model for healthcare workflows designed to address these specific challenges while facilitating effective clinical data structuring and integration.",
        "methodology": "The proposed method, SoftTiger, represents a family of clinical LLMs (Large Language Models) specifically designed for healthcare workflows. SoftTiger is made available as an open-source resource, encouraging free research and experimentation. \n\nKey components and innovations include:\n\n1. **Open-source Release**: The SoftTiger models are provided for free, aiming to foster research and experimentation in clinical settings.\n\n2. **Training and Validation**: The models undergo fine-tuning processes, which shows the training and validation loss curves. This indicates the model's performance and the adjustment of parameters during its development phase.\n\n3. **Table 1 Summary**: Although specific details from Table 1 are not provided here, it likely includes essential information about the various versions of the SoftTiger models, their capacities, training datasets, and perhaps initial performance metrics.\n\n4. **Visualization**: Visual insights into the model's training process and maybe other aspects like architecture or comparative analysis.\n\nIn essence, SoftTiger aims to support healthcare professionals by leveraging advanced LLMs, with an emphasis on accessibility and transparency through its open-source nature.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup:**\n\n**Datasets:** The training and evaluation of the SoftTiger clinical LLMs were structured around a dataset composed of patient clinical data, which is characterized by high-density and noisy narrative content. This dataset is designed to replicate the practical scenarios that physicians typically encounter in their workflows.\n\n**Baselines:** To gauge the effectiveness of the SoftTiger model, the study compared its performance against other popular general models in the field. These models are presumably well-known LLMs that are commonly used in natural language processing tasks.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:** The evaluation of the SoftTiger model focused on the structural extraction and summarization capabilities of the LLM. The criteria for satisfactory results were not explicitly stated in terms of specific metrics but were implied through the comparative performance with the baseline models in the aspects of structuring and summarizing clinical data. \n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\nThe SoftTiger clinical LLMs demonstrated satisfactory results, particularly excelling in structural extraction and natural language interaction when compared to other popular general models. While the exact quantitative results were not specified, the text implies that SoftTiger outperformed the baselines on these fronts. Additionally, it was noted that, despite these promising performance indicators, hallucination remains a significant issue due to the statistical nature of LLMs, which necessitates further development to ensure model reliability in clinical settings.\n\nOverall, the successful structuring and summarizing of patient data signify a reduction in cognitive load for physicians, highlighting SoftTiger's potential to alleviate the healthcare delivery overburden."

TigerBot and Llama-2 chat models were then evaluated using next-token prediction. Both models were initially trained on a 4k context length, without domain-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations were conducted using 4k and 8k context windows.",
            "result_discussion": "TigerBot outperformed Llama-2 in both 4k and 8k evaluation context windows. Notably, Llama-2 performed catastrophically worse when evaluated using the 8k context length, likely due to its under-representation of clinical vocabulary which led to worsened hallucination.",

Initially, a dataset of 300 examples was used for next-token prediction, with examples derived from 100 clinical notes sampled from MIMIC IV and task completions by Azure OpenAI GPT-4. Secondly, a ChatBot Arena was implemented with LLM-as-a-Judge using Azure OpenAI GPT-4 for blind pairwise evaluation. The dataset consisted of 100 answers for the Patient Clinical Summary task by various models, including both closed and open-source LLMs. A control group model with intentionally wrong information was also included. The intelligence-inspired chess ELO rating system was used for evaluation.",
            "result_discussion": "SoftTiger models outperformed Llama-2 for both model sizes and evaluation context lengths. The SoftTiger-70b model showed slight superiority over the 13b model. Using the ELO rating system, optimized SoftTiger-70b model was near Gemini-pro, while the lightweight and cost-effective SoftTiger-13b model showed feasibility for deployment and surpassed GPT-3.5-Turbo and Mixtral-8x7b. The evaluation method was noted to be cost-effective, enabling rapid iterative experimentation and optimization at scale.",
