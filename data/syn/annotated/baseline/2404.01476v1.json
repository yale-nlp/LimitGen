    "title": "TraveLER: A Multi-LMM Agent Framework for Video Question-Answering",
    "abstract": "Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in video question-answering using a frame-wise approach by leveraging large-scale, image-based pretraining in a zero-shot manner. While image-based methods for videos have shown impressive performance, a current limitation is that they often overlook how key timestamps are selected and cannot adjust when incorrect timestamps are identified. Moreover, they are unable to extract details relevant to the question, instead providing general descriptions of the frame. To overcome this, we design a multi-LMM agent framework that travels along the video, iteratively collecting relevant information from keyframes through interactive question-asking until there is sufficient information to answer the question. Specifically, we propose TraveLER, a model that can create a plan to \u201cTraverse\u201d through the video, ask questions about individual frames to \u201cLocate\u201d and store key information, and then \u201cEvaluate\u201d if there is enough information to answer the question. Finally, if there is not enough information, our method is able to \u201cReplan\u201d based on its collected knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed TraveLER approach improves performance on several video question-answering benchmarks, such as NExT-QA, STAR, and Perception Test, without the need to fine-tune on specific datasets.",

            "text": "Over the last few years, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated tremendous progress in the area of video understanding, particularly for the video question-answering (VideoQA) domain. More recently, LMMs have been able to achieve impressive results through video-based models. However, video models require a high level of computational complexity to fine-tune, and annotations are difficult and expensive to collect. As a result, many recent approaches operate on a frame level, leveraging large-scale image-based pretraining in a zero-shot setting.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of image-based LMMs for image tasks, applying them to VideoQA is challenging since using all frames results in high computational demands and redundancy. Thus, many works try to select subsets of frames, either through uniform sampling or keyframe selection. However, uniform sampling may skip important information, while keyframe selection methods might select the wrong frames and mislead the model. To address this, we introduce a novel video traversal approach using a \u201cPlanner,\u201d an LLM agent that creates a plan to find and extract key information.\n\nNext, we wish to ensure we can capture correct and detailed information from frames when executing the plan. Yet, the common captioning approach provides general descriptions for the frame, whereas answering questions often requires more specific details. Moreover, not all elements of the frame are relevant to the question and may even be misleading. As a result, we propose an interactive question-answering process using a \u201cLocator\u201d to locate and extract the most relevant and fine-grained details from each frame. Specifically, we use two LMM agents, one who asks questions about the frame and another who answers them.\n\nNevertheless, it can be difficult for the model to collect all necessary details in a single pass, and extracting incorrect information may be misleading. Hence, we introduce an iterative approach using an \u201dEvaluator\u201d that reviews collected information after each iteration and evaluates if it has enough information to answer the question. If there is, the answer is selected; otherwise, the new information is used to \u201dReplan\u201d and begin a new iteration.\n\nConsider the example in Figure 1. Suppose we are asked \u201dwhy the boy turned over in the middle of the video\u201d. In the first iteration, our method uses temporal cues from the question to skip to the middle of the video and asks questions to find the relevant frames. In the next iteration, we gather more information. Asking about what the boy is doing, we learn that he is \u201dstanding up at the bottom of the slide\u201d and is not looking at anything specific, which informs us that the boy is no longer \u201dsitting down\u201d or \u201dresting on the yellow object\u201d. To eliminate these choices, we must confirm that the boy does not sit back down again by traveling to a timestamp near the end of the video. Finally, since we have collected enough information and followed the plans, we can select the right choice that the baby turns over to be on his stomach \u201dto get down on slide\u201d.\n\nOur proposed approach \u2013 Traverse, Locate, Evaluate, and Replan (TraveLER), is a modular, multi-LMM agent framework for video question answering. Our framework is composed of four main stages, each with LLM or LMM \u201cagents\u201d that interact with each other through the different stages. First, in the Traversal stage (\u201ctraverse\u201d), an agent creates a plan to answer the question. In the Locator stage (\u201clocate\u201d), an agent uses the plan to decide which timestamp of the video to select. The corresponding frames are then sent to another agent, which asks questions and stores the answers in a memory bank for future iterations. Finally, in the Evaluator stage (\u201cevaluate\u201d), an agent reviews all collected information and decides whether to answer or create a modified plan (\u201creplan\u201d) to start the next iteration if necessary.\n\nTo summarize, our main contributions are as follows:\n(i) We introduce TraveLER, a modular multi-LMM agent framework for video question-answering. (ii) Our proposed TraveLER method does not require task-specific fine-tuning or video annotations, as well as being easy to employ with several different LLM or LMMs. (iii) Our method shows improved performance on multiple difficult video question-answering benchmarks such as NExT-QA, Perception Test, and STAR, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach."

            "text": "Video Question-Answering.\n\nVideo question-answering (VideoQA) involves answering free-form or multiple choice questions given an input video. In comparison to image question answering, VideoQA poses unique challenges because it often requires strong temporal understanding and the ability to deal with long input sequences. Many recent works have focused on training end-to-end video-language models (Fu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022a; Ye et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022), but doing so remains challenging due to computational constraints and difficulties in architecture scaling. As a result, many approaches adopt pretrained image models to the video domain by extracting information independently from each frame (Xue et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a). In this work, we design a framework that builds an adaptive plan to traverse through the video to identify keyframes and extract relevant information using a question-answering approach.\n\nLarge Multimodal Models for Video Understanding.\n\nLMMs have been shown to be extremely useful for VideoQA. Some methods use supervised or contrastive training to perform video-LMM pretraining (Zhao et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b), while others adapt existing LMMs and use instruction tuning to adapt them to the video domain (Zhang et al., 2023c; Maaz et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023a). However, recent improvements in LMM capabilities have allowed for many strong approaches for few-shot (Alayrac et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b) and zero-shot VideoQA (Yang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). Uniformly sampling frames at random may result in the model missing important visual information and focusing on unimportant frames (Wu et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2021b). In contrast to these works, which select all keyframes in a single pass, we introduce a zero-shot, iterative method that repeatedly gathers data from various timestamps until enough information is collected to correctly answer the question.\n\nLMM-based Agents for Videos.\n\nThe strong reasoning abilities of LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022) have made them effective in LLM-based agent approaches for videos, where an LLM performs much of the reasoning after collecting information from different modules (Chen et al., 2023a; Lin et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023b; Zeng et al., 2022). For example, Socratic Models (Zeng et al., 2022) proposes a method to reason about videos based on generated audio transcriptions and CLIP frame similarity scores, while other works like VideoChatCaptioner (Chen et al., 2023a) proposes a way to caption videos through chat dialogues between an LLM and a LMM. Unlike these works, our method utilizes a novel video traversal approach and an iterative, planning-based information gathering process."

            "text": "Traversal. In the Traversal stage, we create a plan for how to traverse through the video, which is a list of textual instructions that guide our approach to answering the question. To achieve this, we use the task prompt, which is an instruction to create a plan for answering the question. We combine this with the question and memory bank, which is a dictionary of collected information keyed by timestamps and containing information from the corresponding frame, to receive the final prompt.\n\nOur method uses a memory bank to store collected information, which allows information to persist and to be updated as we proceed through different iterations. We initialize the memory bank with captions of 5 evenly sampled frames throughout the video. This memory initialization provides the model with context for the general idea of the video, performing better than starting with an empty memory. After the first iteration, we add information iteratively using the Extractor module, which will be discussed later.\n\nNext, we input the prompt into the LLM, which returns response, a step-by-step plan on how to traverse through the video and what information the model needs to collect. Our next step is to use the plan in the Locator stage to locate keyframes and extract the information that we will use to answer the question.\n\nLocator. The Locator is a component that consists of two submodules, the Retriever and the Extractor. The Retriever selects the timestamps of the next frames to view, while the Extractor extracts relevant information from these frames, using a question-answering process. Next, we discuss each component in more detail.\n\n(i) Retriever: The Retriever carries out the given plan by selecting which frames to view next. The Retriever is an LLM-based submodule whose goal is to use the collected information to find the next timestamp to select in order to fulfill the plan. The task prompt is an instruction that contains information about the video length and asks which timestamp to view next. Thus, we insert the question, plan, and collected information into the task prompt to create the new prompt.\n\nGiven the prompt, the LLM in the Retriever returns the next set of timestamps. The module then retrieves frames at the timestamp.\n\n(ii) Extractor: The Extractor captures more relevant and question-specific details from the visual input, unlike using only captions. We pass the frames selected by the retriever into the Extractor submodule, which consists of two large models: an LLM to generate context-dependent questions about the frames and a different vision-language LMM, whose job is to extract the desired information from the same frames.\n\nIn this module, we first generate a general caption for the frame using the LLM. Then, we concatenate the caption, plan, memory, and the Extractor task prompt, which is an instruction that asks to use available information to create 3 questions to ask about the current frame. This results in a new prompt.\n\nNext, we input this new prompt into the LLM to get a set of questions about each frame, where is a parameter for how many questions to ask about each frame. In this way, the generated questions take into account both the plan and information from past and future frames of the video. We then use the frame and the corresponding questions as input into the vision-language LMM. The vision-language LMM then outputs a set of answers, where each answer corresponds to a question.\n\nFinally, to use this collected information in future iterations, we update our memory bank. To do this, we use the timestamp as our key and the question-answer pair list as the value, and append this to our memory bank. If the memory bank dictionary is too long, we summarize it by using the memory bank as input to another LLM and instruct it to make the memory bank entries more concise while retaining the same keys and format. This output becomes our new memory bank.\n\nEvaluator. The Evaluator decides if there is enough information and determines if the plan has been followed. We concatenate the memory information, the plan, the question, and the choices with the task prompt. The task prompt is an instruction to evaluate if there is enough information to answer the question and if the given plan has been fulfilled. Thus, we get a new prompt.\n\nWe use this prompt as input into the LLM in the Evaluator, which evaluates if there is enough information to answer the question and if the plan has been completely followed. If both are true, the Evaluator outputs the best choice to answer the question. Otherwise, it provides an explanation on why there is not enough information and gives this explanation to the Planner to start a new iteration of the process.\n\nRe-planning. After each iteration, if the evaluator decides that there is not enough information to answer the question or if the plan has not been completed, the existing memory will be provided to the Planner in the next iteration, in addition to an explanation for why an answer was not chosen. The Planner then outputs a new plan, restarting the process. We also implement a limit on the number"

More implementation details, such as prompts and dataset-specific details are in the Supplementary in Section B ###reference_###.\n\nMemory bank.\nWe represent past collected information as a Python dictionary, with the timestamp of different frames as keys and a list of extracted information from the frame as the values. This extracted information consists of a brief caption of the frame and a list of question-answer pairs. To prevent the memory bank from becoming too large, we also implement a summarizer module that instructs an LLM to summarize the memory bank and return a more concise version in the same dictionary format as before.\n\nAgent model selection. Our modular approach has the benefit of allowing us to easily swap in different LLMs and LMMs (see Section 4.4 ###reference_###). For our main experiments, we use LLaVA-1.6 for and GPT-4 for .\n\nMulti-frame selection.\nWe also allow for the Retriever to select multiple frames instead of a single frame. This helps the model to better capture events that happen quickly or require more context to recognize. For example, if we want to find the action of a \"a woman clapping her hands,\" single frame selection may cause us to incorrectly assume the woman is not clapping if we view the frame where their hands are apart. We do this by creating an optional parameter called window size. The window size refers to the number of frames the Retriever extracts each time. When the window size is non-zero, the Retriever still specifies a single timestamp to go to, but when retrieving the frame at that timestamp we take the number of frames specified by the window size before and after the selected frame as well."

Unless otherwise specified, we use GPT-3.5 as the LLM and LLaVA-1.6 as the LMM for all agents.\n\nSubstituting different agents.\nIn our method, we use LLMs and LMMs as the main agents. To understand how the choice of the LLM and LMM affects our framework\u2019s performance, we swap different LLMs and LMMs into our framework (see Table 4(a)). First, we examine the performance of our framework using different LLMs while fixing the LMM. For this, we use LLaVA-1.6 as our LMM, and we find that GPT-4 performs the best in our framework by a significant margin of +5.4% compared to GPT-3.5. We hypothesize that stronger LLMs perform better in our framework due to how the LLM components are required to perform advanced reasoning tasks. Second, we measure the performance of our framework using different LMMs while fixing the LLM to be GPT-3.5. We find that LLaVA-1.6 performs best, GPT-4V is slightly worse (-0.9%), and BLIP-2 is significantly worse (-7.7%).\n\nAblating the Planner.\nThe Planner module outputs a plan, a list of instructions that guides the behavior of all other modules. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this module, we remove it from our framework. We find that removing the Planner leads to a drop in accuracy of -2.3%. This may be due to several reasons. First, the Planner provides many temporal cues that guide the Retriever module\u2019s search, such as \u201cgo to the middle of the video\u201d, and without these cues, the Retriever is not as good at selecting the next timestamp. Moreover, the Planner also helps the Evaluator better decide when to stop since in our iterative approach, the Evaluator uses the plan to determine when to stop.\n\nAblating the Retriever.\nThe Retriever module determines the next timestamps to view, which helps focus our traversal and information collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Retriever, we uniformly sample frames from the video at 2-second intervals. We find that this leads to a reduction in overall accuracy by -3.5%. Our results suggest that compared to uniform sampling, the Retriever allows us to capture frames that might have otherwise been skipped. This also indicates that our Retriever selects fewer unimportant frames that might mislead the model.\n\nAblating the Extractor.\nQuestion asking is a key component of our model as it allows us to capture more fine-grained and question-relevant information in comparison to simple caption generation, which produces a generic description. As such, we ablate the Extractor by only allowing the LMM to caption frames. We find that this decreases performance by -2.2%, suggesting that the ability to ask specific questions about a frame is important. We notice that many generated captions capture the main idea of visual information in the frame, but often miss fine-grained details that are useful for answering the question.\n\nRetriever window size.\nTo evaluate the impact of window size, which is the number of frames the Retriever extracts centered around the selected frame, we experiment with multiple-frame retrieval. This allows capturing better actions that occur quickly or require more context to understand. As shown in Table 4(b), we find that choosing 5 frames yields the best results and a +1.4% increase when compared to selecting a single frame, but viewing more than 5 decreases performance. This suggests that the ability to retrieve multiple frames is beneficial in allowing the model to better capture relevant information, but retrieving too many frames can lead to too much information, resulting in performance drops.\n\nThe number of questions.\nQuestion answering allows us to extract more specific details from our visual inputs. However, we noticed that too many questions can yield irrelevant questions and false positives. As such, we experiment with modifying the number of questions asked for each frame by our extractor (see Table 4(c)). We record results for a 5-question, 3-question, and 1-question maximum. Note that 0-questions asked is equivalent to only allowing captions, which is discussed in the Extractor ablation. From our results, we find that a 3-question limit yields the best results compared to asking 1 or 5 questions (+2.0%/+0.8%). This suggests that asking questions helps in extracting relevant information, but too many questions can lead to false positives or too much irrelevant information.\n\nMemory bank initialization and formatting.\nOur memory bank is a critical part of our framework since it stores information that all modules rely on to evaluate inputs and make decisions. First, we experiment with different initializations as it must be initialized in the first iteration. We experiment"

Despite the promising results, video models come with their set of challenges, primarily due to the high computational complexity required for fine-tuning and difficulties in obtaining annotations. Consequently, there's a trend towards using image-based LMMs in a zero-shot setting to address these issues. Nevertheless, applying these models to VideoQA necessitates efficient frame selection to mitigate computational demands and redundancy without losing critical information.\n\n**Research Problem:**\nThe primary research problem tackled in this paper is the challenge of effectively applying image-based LMMs to the VideoQA domain. Specifically, the paper addresses issues associated with high computational demands and redundancy when using all video frames, as well as the pitfalls of existing frame selection methods like uniform sampling and keyframe selection. The objective is to develop a method that can traverse video content to extract and utilize the most relevant information necessary for answering video-based questions accurately, without the need for exhaustive fine-tuning or extensive video annotations.\n\n**Relevant Prior Work:**\n1. **Video Understanding and VideoQA with LMMs:**\n   - **Fu et al.

(2022):** Achieved impressive results through video-based models but highlighted the computational complexity and annotation challenges.\n   \n2. **Image-based LMMs in Zero-Shot Settings:**\n   - **Xue et al. (2023), Yu et al. (2023), Zhang et al. (2023a):** Focused on image-based pretraining to mitigate computational and annotation difficulties, operating at a frame level.\n\n3. **Frame Selection Methods:**\n   - **Uniform Sampling:** Discussed in Zhang et al. (2023a), which may skip crucial information.\n   - **Keyframe Selection:** Addressed in Yu et al. (2023a), could potentially mislead the model by selecting incorrect frames.\n\nThe proposed solution builds on these foundations by introducing the TraveLER framework, which includes stages for planning, locating, evaluating, and replanning to extract relevant and detailed information iteratively and efficiently. This method aims to circumvent the limitations of prior works by employing a modular multi-agent approach, optimizing both the selection of relevant frames and the extraction of fine-grained details for accurate question-answering.",
        "methodology": "### TraveLER: A Multi-LMM Agent Framework for Video Question-Answering\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nTo design a robust approach that can find the correct keyframes and extract the most relevant information for VideoQA, we propose a modular LMM agent framework that Traverses, Locates, Evaluates, and Replans iteratively (TraveLER). The key components and innovations of this method are outlined as follows:\n\n1. **General LLM and LMM Architectures (Section 3.1):**\n   - Detailed descriptions of the underlying large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) used in the framework.\n\n2. **Pipeline Components (Section 3.2):**\n   - **Traverse:** The framework starts by navigating through the video to identify potential keyframes that might contain relevant information.\n   - **Locate:** The system then accurately locates specific keyframes that are most likely to contain the answer to the given question.\n   - **Evaluate:** It evaluates the content of these keyframes, extracting and analyzing the most pertinent information.\n   - **Replan:** Based on the evaluation, the system may replan and iterate through the process, refining its search and analysis to improve accuracy.\n\n3. **Implementation Details (Section 3.3):**\n   - Specific details regarding the implementation of the aforementioned components within the framework.\n\nThis modular approach ensures a systematic and thorough analysis by progressively narrowing down on the most essential video content to answer questions accurately.",
