    "title": "Is Temperature the Creativity Parameter of Large Language Models?",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism. The temperature parameter of an LLM regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter. Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model, and prompt. Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the LLM output for different temperature values using the Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking, which evaluates the creative potential through factors like fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality. However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the \u201ccreativity parameter\u201d claim; overall results suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher. Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs), in particular instruction-tuned variants, like ChatGPT and Claude, have become ubiquitous tools in society. Unsurprisingly, they\u2019ve also found use for performing and assisting in creative tasks, such as writing stories (?), poems (?), jokes (?), dialogues in video games (?), and more. For creative tasks, temperature is often described as the parameter that enables creative behaviour in a language model (?; ?; ?). Temperature controls the uncertainty or randomness in the generation process, leading to more diverse outcomes by balancing probabilities for candidate words. However, randomness alone does not capture a complex phenomenon such as creativity (?), it would imply that noise is the most interesting thing one can create (?). Creativity is a quality that cannot be attributed by simply producing more diverse output but involves multiple dimensions, such as social interactions and communication, or independence and freedom (?), that are not easily quantifiable. Yet, one probe into LLM creativity has found a limited positive effect on creativity at higher temperatures on a divergent association task (?); however, they do not account for the influence of other factors, such as different prompts. Temperature may have an effect on creativity, simply because without variation, nothing new can be created, but it is unclear if LLMs have sufficient \u201cknowledge\u201d so that randomness is all you need. The main goal of this paper is to investigate how temperature affects the creativity of stories. LLMs are challenging to reliably probe and most analyses of their capabilities and behaviours involve large benchmarks, which are challenging to interpret due to their scale and aggregation of outcomes. For example, many LLMs appear to have difficulty with understanding multiple choice questions, even though this task is part of many benchmarks (?). Reproducibility and reliability is further complicated by small differences in prompts that can lead to vastly different outcomes (?). Moreover, we often do not know the training data, have insight of the model architecture and additional plugins or processing for commercial LLMs. To improve reliability and reproducibility, we predetermine a fixed context: model and prompt. Key to our evaluation approach is the exemplar object, the greedy sample for that context, which is the baseline for our experiments. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and a creativity evaluation with human participants of stories generated by Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking on four necessary conditions for creativity: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. The primary findings of this work are: In general, temperature does not allow the LLM to leverage different regions of the embedding space, but it does enable some novelty when generating limited samples (as is the case for any real-world application). We observe a weak positive correlation between temperature and novelty, and unsurprisingly, a negative correlation between temperature and coherence. Suggesting a trade-off between novelty and coherence. Overall, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than the \u201ccreativity parameter\u201d claim suggests. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our approach, and conclude with a discussion on creative outputs of LLMs to rely less on chance."

The jump in output fidelity and ease-of-use are proving to radically change the landscape of creative tasks that a machine can perform. LLMs certainly seem capable of producing novelty, typicality, and grammatically fluent output, but it is difficult to determine how exactly to approach such a creativity evaluation. In this section, we describe the difficulties with probing LLMs and build a foundation drawing from cognitive science for our research approach. To investigate temperature as the creativity parameter, we first need to establish what we mean by creativity and what conditions we require outputs of the LLM to satisfy. \n\nAs a methodological framework, we turn to the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), which have been widely used for assessing creativity in individuals. The TTCT provides a structured approach to evaluate creativity by measuring factors such as fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. By adopting this framework, our goal is to apply similar criteria to assess the outputs of LLMs, thereby aligning our evaluation with established cognitive models of creativity. Through this approach, we aim to shed light on the conditions under which machine-generated text can be considered creative according to cognitive science standards."

            "text": "In artistic domains, we consider something creative if it is novel or original and useful or effective (?; ?). Usefulness is closely related to quality and value, as things of low-quality tend not to be very useful or have much value. Moreover, because creativity is such a complex phenomenon, further properties have been proposed, such as surprise (?; ?) and typicality (?). Both of these properties are often viewed as variants of novelty, and the differences are very subtle. If something surprises you, there must be something that you have not seen before, something unexpected. Indeed, ? (?) draws a similar observation, noting that novelty is the disruption of expectedness. Typicality is more interesting because the difference is that before we ask any questions regarding novelty and quality, we must consider the prior question; to what extent is something typical? Is the object an example of its class or genre? Typicality and novelty are, like surprise and novelty, somewhat at odds, as high typicality often implies low novelty; however, Ritchie suggests that typicality is a prerequisite for evaluating creativity, meaning that for something to be judged as novel it has to some extent be typical first. This view lends itself well for this work because we only consider the creativity of large language models based on the artefacts it produces and not in a larger scope. While we do not use Ritchie\u2019s empirical criteria directly, his perspective fits our purpose as we mainly evaluate the artefact of the system and not the process behind it, over a framework like the Creative Tripod (?), which specifically focuses on the behaviour of creative systems. The Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking (?) formulates the essential properties as follows: novelty is the extent to which the produced item is dissimilar to existing samples within its class, typicality is the extent to which the produced item is an example of the class in question, and quality is the extent to which the produced item is a high-quality example of its class. For narrative writing tasks specifically, it is relatively poorly understood what is valued for creativity, for example, the importance of genre is unclear (?). In a large creative writing literature survey, ? (?) outlines various criteria drawn from a large body of work. For example, a narrative needs to have an elaborate plot, an original voice, interesting characters, a good flow, linguistic originality, among many more. These criteria largely connect with the essential properties above, and we use these to outline four necessary conditions to establish if temperature affects creativity for the narrative generation task in this study. Hence, we require novelty, typicality, and quality in terms of cohesion and coherence (?). Novelty and typicality are relatively straightforward to reformulate in this domain. We would say that a story is novel if it is dissimilar to other stories, if it has some characteristics that set it apart from other stories, for example, it may be written in a novel setting or narrative style. A story is considered typical if it is of the same form as other stories in the same category. For example, based on stories we have read before, we can observe certain patterns, narrative style, and other characteristics. When we are presented with another story, we say it is typical if it follows similar rules or patterns and has those same characteristics, i.e., it has the same form. Quality, in general, can mean a wide variety of things, and can be defined depending on what you value. For example, large language models can easily and fluently write high-quality texts in terms of grammar and spelling, but this falls short for our purposes since the generated stories can be entirely meaningless or nonsensical. A key aspect of a good story is a good narrative, that it is cohesive and coherent. The difference between cohesion and coherence is subtle, as pointed out by ? (?). Cohesion is about the objective features in a text that hold everything together, in other words, sentences are well-connected, are characters, events, and actions used appropriately. Coherence, however, is about the reader\u2019s interpretation and the meaningfulness of the text. The reader should be able to easily follow and understand what it means. For our purposes, we consider the quality of a story as a combination of cohesion and coherence; A story is considered cohesive if words and sentences are connected and grammatically consistent, and that characters, events and actions are used appropriately. A story is coherent if it is easy to follow the story and understand what it is about."

We focus here on using LLMs that are already instruction-tuned, meaning they are fine-tuned for conversation following a specific prompting format. An instruction-tuned LLM can respond to instruction and appear to \u201cunderstand\u201d what is asked of them (?). This suggests that by changing the context in the prompt, we can tap into different \u201cslices of knowledge\u201d of the learned probability distribution. In a co-creative or interactive setting, one might ask to change details and refine previously generated poems or stories, allowing for more creative outcomes. In essence, by tweaking the prompt, we narrow down the sampling distribution closer to the intended outcome. Adjusting the prompt to get the \u201cright\u201d slice of the probability distribution, however, is very sensitive to the choice of words and even punctuation (?). It becomes increasingly difficult to separate the effect of the prompt as you allow more randomness via the temperature hyperparameter in the generation process. If temperature is the creativity parameter, then you would expect something similar to what happens when you change the prompt; that at higher temperatures, the LLM will venture into different slices of its knowledge. However, it is difficult with this kind of investigation to reliably reproduce outputs and make comparisons across different models, prompts and hyperparameter settings, to draw any conclusions. Therefore, it is essential for our evaluation to fix the context; the prompt and model, and all other parameters, except for temperature.\n\nThe Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking is widely considered a standard to measure creativity and involves a variety of tasks designed to assess divergent thinking and problem-solving skills in individuals. It measures qualities such as fluency, originality, abstractness of titles, elaboration, and resistance to premature closure. As a creative assessment, it taps into different cognitive aspects that contribute to creative output. By using the Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking, researchers can explore the creative capabilities of individuals in terms of generating and expanding upon original ideas. The test provides a structured format which allows for the assessment of the ability to think divergently and adjust thinking in novel ways. In controlled experimental settings, the test can provide insights into how various parameters affect creative performance and can serve to benchmark progress or differences in creative expression among individuals or groups."

First, seeing that the peak of distributions is the most probable or average outcome, using the prototype theory perspective, it is straightforward to view the greedy sample as the prototype. In that case, a category is every possible output produced by one prompt and one model, with the greedy sample as its prototype. However, there are many prompts that can generate similar outcomes. The second perspective departs from this more abstract view. In that frame, the category is a group of prompts and a model, and the greedy sample for each prompt is an exemplar. For the purposes of this work, we call the greedy output the exemplar object, but notably, prototype would also be a viable description, since we consider only one prompt for the human evaluation."

This test is competitive, but more importantly, it provides a well-established framework for assessing creativity so that we have full access to the assessment criteria and scoring methods. This is essential since we aim to eliminate or minimise any effects besides the temperature parameter. Closed-source models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, are for these reasons not viable as they are not transparent. The Torrance Test is based on decades of research on creative thinking, and it is fine-tuned using various creativity tasks and evaluations. For the instructions, we aimed for a minimal and neutral prompt (1 ###reference_ompt1###) so that it introduces as little additional information as possible. \n\nWe applied 6-bit quantisation,\u200b222Quantised using the llama.cpp library with setting Q6_K. See https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684  ###reference_l/1684### which reduces the model size with extremely minimal loss of quality (?), to make it fit on available hardware. The Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking adds, unsurprisingly, much conversation to the output, instead of just performing the task, even when instructed to avoid this in the system prompt. This is unwanted behaviour, as it has a large effect on subsequent stories. To mitigate this, we added a minimal start of the LLMs response (see 1 ###reference_ompt1###) to make sure that this is consistent across all generated stories. Another benefit is that it reduced any post-processing for the human evaluation study, besides, occasionally, pruning one sentence at the end of the output that was not part of the story.\n\nWe set top- = 50 and disabled all other decoding strategies. Setting top- and thereby limiting the token candidates at each time step, influences the output but is necessary; otherwise, text quality quickly deteriorates (?), especially at higher temperatures.

Measuring quality using an independent model is more appropriate, but it raises the question of what is a suitable candidate for a narrative generation task. Moreover, previous work suggests that perplexity is a bad indicator of text quality compared to human evaluations (?). For these reasons, we focus more on diversity and similarity. An overall higher diversity proportional to temperature should indicate that different slices of the probability distribution are used to generate the outputs. Comparisons for diversity and similarity can be done on the lexical level, which uses the texts directly, or on a semantic level using stories embedded in the LLM\u2019s embedding space. We focus on two commonly used measures that can be used relative to the exemplar; on the semantic level, we use cosine similarity with the embeddings of the stories and the exemplar, and for the lexical level, we use normalised edit distance between stories and the exemplar. If temperature is proportional to creativity, then you would expect the outputs to extend into very different regions of the embedding space.

Cosine similarity shows a weak negative trend, but also shows that there is great overlap in the range of outputs for each temperature value (1(b)  ###reference_.sf2###). In other words, outputs at higher temperatures on the semantic level, do not extend much further away from the exemplar story than outputs at lower temperatures. In theory, given enough time and space, we should be able to generate outputs from every region of the embedding that the context of prompt and model can be generated, even at lower temperatures. However, when drawing limited samples from the Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking, as is standard in any real-world scenario, we do observe some exploration at higher temperatures as is shown in Figure 2  ###reference_###. At the very least, it appears that temperature increases the chance of finding novelty more quickly. Another interesting observation is that it seems, relative to the exemplar story, that the generation process moves in a particular direction (Figure 2  ###reference_###). This suggests some merit to the link we draw with prototype and exemplar theory and our approach to evaluation, as it shows how Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking outputs changes relative to the exemplar.

The questions about novelty, typicality, and cohesion are on a five-point scale from 1) not at all, to 5) completely. Notably, coherence is on a five-point scale from 1) very easy, to 5) very difficult to understand and follow. As a result, lower scores indicate high coherence, and vice versa. The survey distribution procedure was set up such that each story received at least five evaluations by different participants.

The key limitation of this study is its size; we recruited 36 participants, who can only evaluate a limited number of stories. We generated only 5 unique stories per temperature, relying on the sampling distribution of the LLM to provide an appropriate sample. Ideally, you would generate many stories and then take a representative sample, but we do not know what number is sufficient for our purpose. Similarly, we only considered one prompt and its exemplar, ultimately, we decided on, in our opinion, the most minimal and neutral instruction to perform the task (1  ###reference_ompt1###). In this kind of setup, there is a risk of practice and order effects. To mitigate these issues, we asked the participant to first do a practice evaluation, making sure that the participant is fully aware of the task and what is expected of them. As mentioned, we randomly assigned stories to the participants, and did not observe any ordering effects in the analysis. We considered using pairwise comparison ranking, and presenting stories in pairs and evaluating those relative to each other, to further mitigate these effects. While this method is effective towards that purpose, it does not scale very well, even with just 31 stories, it requires a large number of participants for robust and meaningful outcomes. Another limitation of this study is that cohesion and coherence are, in fact, important factors for novelty and typicality. We did not observe any issues with that in the analysis, and as these LLMs produce fluent and grammatically correct language, this does not appear to be an issue. The stories generated by Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking are simple stories featuring only basic elements, and are not literary masterpieces. We are interested in a relative evaluation to see how temperature changes the creativity as it increases only for a simple task; thus we opted to use non-experts who are not preconditioned to higher expectations. For that same reason, we designed the survey around specific criteria and did not ask participants directly about the creativity of the stories."

            "text": "We use linear mixed-effects models to control for the random effect of assigning stories to different participants, and Cronbach\u2019s alpha to test inter-rater reliability. The approach is as follows: First, we determine if there is a significant effect using Satterthwaite\u2019s method. Secondly, the model\u2019s estimate (slope) determines the direction of the effect, i.e., positive or negative, and the rate of change. Finally, we test how much variance is explained by the model to determine the magnitude using conditional R-squared, denoted by R^2, which considers both fixed and random effects. The more variance is captured by the linear mixed-effects model, the stronger the correlation. Additionally, we report the marginal R-squared, which is the variance explained by the fixed effects.\n\nIn this study, we utilized the Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking to assess the creative potential of individuals. This well-established test evaluates creativity through divergent thinking tasks, measuring fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. By administering the Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking, we aim to gain insights into the participants' creative capacities across various domains, thereby enriching our analysis of the data collected."

            "text": "The primary results of the analysis focus on the effect of temperature on the creativity of stories. Regarding inter-rater reliability, on average, we find  = .639 (Table 1  ###reference_###), which is just short of the acceptable level of .7, but still indicates some degree of agreement, more so because we are dealing with non-expert judges who, in general, disagree more often. Regarding temperature, we observe two effects (Table 2  ###reference_###), a weak positive correlation between novelty and temperature ( = .308, SE = .138,  = .385), and a moderate correlation between coherence and temperature ( = .240, SE = .122,  = .646). This implies a trade-off between novelty and coherence. While higher temperatures seem to positively affect the chance of finding novel stories, they become less coherent. Although, coherence is rated lower (M = 2.13), meaning that the stories, overall, were easy to understand. The negative correlation of coherence with temperature is as expected (?). Both effects, have relatively shallow slopes, indicating that the rate at which novelty and coherence change as temperatures get higher is low, indicating only a small effect.\n\nThe secondary results relate the creativity evaluation to the computational metrics in the Computational Analysis  ###reference_x1### section. Note that perplexity is a metric relative to the model, and cosine similarity and normalised edit distance are both relative to the exemplar story. Here, we observe three effects for perplexity, cosine similarity and normalised edit distance in Table 2  ###reference_###. First, we see that perplexity has a weak to moderate positive correlation with novelty ( = .730, SE = .273,  = .370). This is interesting because it suggests that perplexity, although a measure for model quality, could also indicate novelty at least to some extent. Yet, it is also unsurprising because indirectly, higher perplexity is on average a result of higher temperature (see 1(a)  ###reference_.sf1###). There is likely a similar cause for the weak to moderate positive effect between normalised edit distance and novelty ( = 2.01, SE = .731,  = .378). Finally, there is a weak to moderate positive effect between cosine similarity and cohesion ( = 2.09, SE = .716,  = .431), which is not unexpected as higher temperatures produce outputs with greater variety, subsequently, increasing the likelihood of producing non-cohesive texts. More interestingly, this suggests that stories closer to the exemplar are more cohesive. In turn, this implies when the semantic distance between a story and the exemplar is large, more features related to cohesion are lost. The slopes of the analysis with the computational metrics are steeper, especially the latter two have a high rate of change, looking at 1(b)  ###reference_.sf2### and 1(c)  ###reference_.sf3###, this could be due to the large difference between the lowest and highest temperatures."

Most participants reported very little to no experience with writing and reviewing stories. Those that did report to have done writing were mostly relying on educational experience. We specifically asked the participants about their approach for evaluating stories to gain further insights in what specifically they focused on. Participants reported different ways in which they approached the evaluation, some focused on structure, another aimed to grab the general idea combined and compared the ending. Occasionally, the participant chose one specific factor, such as most stories were adventure-based, and took that as the typical trait. Another example, is that when a story switches genre, for example, to fantasy, it was considered more novel. In line with this, participants did report that it was quite difficult to separate details in the stories as they went through the evaluation, and that it was quite difficult to just use the four conditions as there were different characteristics in the story they had to weigh. One participant reported a lack of cohesion, and that sometimes it felt that sentences were skipped, misplaced, or there was something missing. These reports suggest that for each criterion, different things are expected and valued in LLM-generated stories."

We only observe a weak positive correlation between novelty and temperature, and a moderately negative correlation between coherence and temperature, implying a novelty and coherence trade-off.

        "paper_title": "Is Temperature the Creativity Parameter of Large Language Models?",
        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation:\n\nThe motivation for the paper stems from the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude in creative tasks such as writing stories, poems, jokes, and dialogues in video games. The commonly held belief is that temperature, a parameter controlling randomness in LLMs, is pivotal for creativity. However, the authors argue that creativity is a multi-dimensional quality that involves more than just randomness. There is limited understanding of how temperature genuinely affects creativity in LLM outputs. Hence, the paper aims to empirically investigate this relationship.\n\n### Research Problem:\n\nThe research problem the paper addresses is: **How does temperature affect the creativity of stories generated by large language models?**\n\nThe authors seek to understand whether the parameter of temperature impacts creative output, specifically in the context of story writing, and to what extent it balances novelty and coherence in the generated text.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n\n1. **Use in Creative Tasks**: Large language models have been employed in creative domains such as story writing, poetry, joke creation, and video game dialogues ([?], [?], [?], [?]).\n2. **Temperature and Diversity**: Temperature is often labeled as the parameter that introduces creativity by controlling the randomness in the text generation process ([?], [?], [?]).\n3. **Complexity of Creativity**: Creativity is a complex phenomenon and cannot be solely attributed to increased randomness, as it involves social interactions, communication, independence, and freedom (?), making it challenging to quantify.\n4. **Limited Effect of Temperature on Creativity**: Previous research has shown a limited positive effect of higher temperatures on creativity in divergent association tasks ([?]), but these studies haven't fully accounted for variations caused by different prompts. \n5. **Challenges in LLM Evaluation**: Reliable probing of LLM creativity is difficult due to the scale and aggregation required in benchmarks, small differences in prompts causing vastly different outcomes, and the lack of transparency in training data, model architectures, and additional processing steps used in commercial LLMs ([?], [?]).\n\nBy delving into these prior works, the paper aims to clarify the nuanced effects of temperature on the creativity of LLM-generated stories.",
        "methodology": "Methodology: Rigorously evaluating LLMs is hard. If we consider multiple models, it is difficult to compare their results because the learned representations and the training data could be very different. In the case of a single model, but many prompts, it is difficult to establish a solid baseline, and therefore also impossible to compare results, since lexical changes can have a cascading effect on the output. Hence, we need to work within a fixed context using a specific model and prompt to establish a baseline that enables the comparison of results against independent variables, such as temperature.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\n**Datasets:**\n- The main experiment involves generating stories using large language models (LLMs) with varying temperature parameters. Specific datasets used to generate prompts or context for the stories are not explicitly detailed in the excerpt provided.\n\n**Baselines:**\n- The primary baseline for comparison in this experiment is likely the performance of the LLMs at standard or default temperature settings. However, other specific baselines are not clearly mentioned in the provided text.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\n- **Computational Analysis Metrics:**\n  - Distribution of stories in the embedding space.\n  - Distance measurement of the stories against an exemplar object.\n\n- **Human Evaluation Metrics:**\n  - Creativity evaluation based on four necessary conditions of creativity (although these conditions are not specified in the excerpt, typical creativity metrics could involve novelty, usefulness, surprise, and coherence).\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n\nThe results are divided into two main analyses:\n\n1. **Computational Analysis:**\n   - The experiment evaluates how the LLM-generated stories are distributed in the embedding space across different temperature values.\n   - It measures the distance of these stories from an exemplar object, analyzing how changes in temperature affect the creativity parameters of the narratives.\n\n2. **Human Evaluation Study:**\n   - Human evaluators assess the creativity of stories generated at various temperature settings.\n   - The focus is on understanding how temperature impacts the four necessary conditions of creativity in narrative generation tasks.\n\nThe detailed results, including numerical data and specific temperature settings that produced the most creative outputs, are not provided in the excerpt."
