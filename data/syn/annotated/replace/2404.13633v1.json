    "abstract": "The ubiquity of smartphones has led to an increase in on demand healthcare being supplied. For example, people can share their illness-related experiences with others similar to themselves, and healthcare experts can offer advice for better treatment and care for remediable, terminal and mental illnesses. As well as this human-to-human communication, there has been an increased use of human-to-computer digital health messaging, such as chatbots. These can prove advantageous as they offer synchronous and anonymous feedback without the need for a human conversational partner. However, there are many subtleties involved in human conversation that a computer agent may not properly exhibit. For example, there are various conversational styles, etiquettes, politeness strategies or empathic responses that need to be chosen appropriately for the conversation. Encouragingly, computers are social actors (CASA) posits that people apply the same social norms to computers as they would do to people. On from this, previous studies have focused on applying conversational strategies to computer agents to make them embody more favourable human characteristics. However, if a computer agent fails in this regard it can lead to negative reactions from users. Therefore, in this dissertation we describe a series of studies we carried out to lead to more effective human-to-computer digital health messaging.",

Namely, the question of \u201cHow should technology communicate with us?\u201d.\nWe want technology which people perceive as understanding their emotions and that responds empathetically.\nHowever, we do not want technology that enters the uncanny valley [137  ###reference_b137###, 330  ###reference_b330###, 290  ###reference_b290###] where communication is seen as almost human-like, but something is not quite right.\nEqually we do not want technology that responds in a way seen as inappropriate to a given situation [72  ###reference_b72###, 56  ###reference_b56###].\nFor example, users may find it less appropriate if a chatbot uses a casual conversational style when discussing their sensitive health information [72  ###reference_b72###].\nIn this case conversational style is an example of a social cue, a signal that saliently conveys meaning to people and leads them to apply social rules, expectations and scripts to interactions [101  ###reference_b101###].\nSocial cues can be split into those that are verbal cues (such as conversational style [72  ###reference_b72###] and conversational content [71  ###reference_b71###, 74  ###"

In such tasks, empowering crowd workers to ideate effectively and creatively is key to achieving high-quality results. Different prompting techniques have been proposed to stimulate creativity and improve the diversity of ideas [5, 91], but they suffer from ideation redundancy, where multiple users express identical or similar ideas [28, 165, 261, 279]. Current efforts to avoid redundancy include iterative or adaptive task workflows [341], constructing a taxonomy of the idea space [145], and visualizing a concept map of peer ideas [279], but these require much manual effort and are not scalable.\n\nInstead, we propose an automatic prompt selection mechanism \u2014 Directed Diversity \u2014 to scale crowd ideation diversity. Directed Diversity composes prompts with one or more phrases to stimulate ideation. It helps to direct workers towards new ideas and away from existing ideas with the workflow: 1) extract phrases from text corpuses in a target domain, 2) embed phrases into a vector embedding, and 3) automatically select phrases for maximum diversity. These phrases are then shown as prompts to ideators to stimulate ideation. The phrase embedding uses the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) [46] to position phrases within an embedding vector space. Using the embedding vectors, we calculated distances between phrases to optimally select phrases that are farthest apart from one another; this maximizes the diversity of the selected phrases. Hence, Directed Diversity guides ideators towards under-utilized phrases or away from existing or undesirable phrases.\n\nThe embedding space provides a basis to calculate quantitative, distance-based metrics to estimate diversity in selected phrases and prompts, and subsequently ideated messages. These metrics can complement empirical measurements from user studies to evaluate prompts and ideations. We curate multiple measures and evaluation techniques and propose a Diversity Prompting Evaluation Framework to evaluate perceived and subjective creativity and objective, computed creativity, and diversity of crowd ideations. We demonstrate the framework with experiments on Directed Diversity to 1) evaluate its efficacy to select diverse prompts in a simulation study, 2) measure the perceived diversity of selected prompts and effort to generate ideas in an ideation study, and 3) evaluate the creativity and diversity of generated ideas in validation studies using quantitative and qualitative analyses. The experiments were conducted with a use case unrelated to motivational messaging, though we discuss how Directed Diversity can apply to other crowd ideation tasks. In summary, our contributions are:\n\nWe present Directed Diversity, a corpus-driven, automatic approach that leverages embedding distances based on a language model to select diverse phrases by maximizing a diversity metric. Using these constrained prompts, crowdworkers are directed to generate more diverse ideas. This results in improved collective creativity and reduced redundancy.\n\nA Diversity Prompting Evaluation Framework to evaluate the efficacy of diversity prompting along an ideation chain. This draws constructs from creativity and diversity literature, metrics computed from a language model embedding, and is validated with statistical and qualitative analyses.\n\nWe applied the evaluation framework in a series of four experiments to evaluate Directed Diversity for prompt selection, and found that it can improve ideation diversity without compromising ideation quality, but at a cost of higher user effort."

Participants talked to a chatbot that either: (1-None) did not explicitly reference their previous week\u2019s utterances, (2-Verbatim) referenced their previous week\u2019s utterances verbatim (e.g.., \u201cLast week you said \u201cMy teeth sometimes hurt when I floss\u201d\u201d), or (3-Paraphrase) referenced their previous week\u2019s utterances using paraphrases (e.g., \u201cLast week you said that your teeth hurt\u201d).\nUsers found chatbots that explicitly referenced their past utterances more intelligent and engaging.\nHowever, explicitly referencing a user\u2019s past utterances also lead to increased feelings of privacy violations.\nTo gain further insights as to why users might have perceived chatbot referencing formats differently, we conducted semi-structured interviews ().\nFinally, we discuss implications and provide recommendations for chatbot designers when scripting interactions that reference user utterances.\n###figure_1###"

These more abstract concepts may require human input or feedback (such as labelled datasets and example utterances, or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [347  ###reference_b347###]) to ensure that computer-delivered messaging systems can reply appropriately.\nAdditionally, LLMs require a flow of example utterances (such as purposely crowd-sourced content, or extracted online content) to keep up to date with changing cultural references, slang, humour and language style.\nPrompt engineering and human judgement could also be used to produce and provide feedback on the appropriateness of responses [35  ###reference_b35###] (such as asking GPT-4 to write and evaluate its own message - see Figure 1.8 in [35  ###reference_b35###]).\nIn recent work, Karinshak et al.

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation:\n\nThe primary motivation behind this paper is to improve the effectiveness of computer-delivered health messaging by making it more positively perceived by users. The paper aims to bridge the gap in current health support provided by technology by addressing issues of empathy and appropriateness in communication. Specifically, the study focuses on creating health messages that are emotionally understanding and avoid entering the uncanny valley or conveying inappropriate social cues.\n\n### Research Problem:\n\nThe research problem the paper addresses revolves around the question: \"How should technology communicate with us?\" The challenge is to develop health messaging technology that users perceive as empathetic and appropriately responsive, without making them uncomfortable or alienating them. The study seeks to investigate text-based computer-delivered verbal cues in health messaging, focusing on the generation and curation of effective messages and exploring the conversation content and conversational style.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n\n1. **Health Guidelines and Social Support**:\n   - It\u2019s critical to follow health guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid chronic diseases ([reference_b263], [reference_b105], [reference_b134], [reference_b282], [reference_b229]).\n   - Social support, such as advice or emotional support, facilitates adherence to healthy behaviors by improving motivation and self-efficacy ([reference_b284], [reference_b32], [reference_b65], [reference_b267], [reference_b93], [reference_b124]).\n\n2. **Limitations of Traditional Social Support**:\n   - The traditional sources of social support (health experts, friends, family) may not be available to everyone due to various constraints ([reference_b103]).\n\n3. **Role of Health Messaging Technologies**:\n   - Health messaging technologies can fill this gap, offering scalable, low-cost, and immediate support ([reference_b3], [reference_b298], [reference_b18], [reference_b245]).\n   - These technologies, like nudging interventions and chatbots, are gaining acceptance ([reference_b325], [reference_b312], [reference_b61], [reference_b254], [reference_b120], [reference_b130], [reference_b219], [reference_b125], [reference_b236]).\n\n4. **Challenges in Health Messaging Technologies**:\n   - Both consumers and physicians have highlighted the lack of empathy and inability to understand human emotions as barriers ([reference_b219], [reference_b236]).\n\n5. **The Uncanny Valley and Social Cues**:\n   - Ensuring technology does not fall into the uncanny valley or use inappropriate social cues is important ([reference_b137], [reference_b330], [reference_b290], [reference_b72], [reference_b56]).\n   - Social cues play a significant role and include verbal, auditory, visual, and invisible cues ([reference_b101], [reference_b38], [reference_b177]).\n\n6. **Computers are Social Actors (CASA)**:\n   - According to CASA, people apply social heuristics to computer interactions, expecting computers to follow similar social rules as humans ([reference_b220], [reference_b111], [reference_b33], [reference_b58], [reference_b205], [reference_b144], [reference_b186]).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThrough this exploration, the paper contributes to the growing body of research that aims to enhance digital health interventions by making them more empathetic and contextually appropriate through the strategic use of verbal cues in health messaging.",

        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup and Results**\n\n**Experiment Setup:**\nTo investigate the effect of a chatbot\u2019s language formality on the quality of a user\u2019s self-disclosure, the researchers carried out two experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Both experiments tested the impact of using either a casual or comparatively formal conversational style.\n\n1. **Datasets:**\n   - **Study 1:** This study did not collect sensitive user information directly but used hypothetical scenarios to gather data on user perceptions and likelihood of information disclosure. The scenarios were designed to vary by domain (health vs non-health information) and information sensitivity (sensitive vs non-sensitive information), with levels of information sensitivity being empirically validated [202 ###reference_b202###].\n   - **Study 2:** This study focused on analyzing the quality of user utterances when discussing health behaviors with a chatbot, thereby evaluating the effectiveness of conversational style in real interactions.\n\n2. **Baselines:**\n   - For both studies, baseline comparisons were made between chatbots adopting a casual conversational style and those adopting a formal conversational style. An objective measure of language formality [135 ###reference_b135###] was used to design the chatbot scripts.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n   - **Study 1:** The primary metrics were user perceptions of the chatbot and the likelihood of information disclosure in hypothetical scenarios.\n   - **Study 2:** The quality of user utterances was the main metric, as higher-quality utterances imply higher-quality self-disclosure to the chatbot.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\n\n- **Study 1 Results:** The findings indicated that for health-related information, users perceived a chatbot with a formal conversational style as more competent and appropriate compared to a chatbot with a casual style. This suggests that the formality of language influences user perceptions, particularly for sensitive health information.\n\n- **Study 2 Results:** It was found that chatbots adopting a formal conversational style elicited higher quality user utterances compared to those using a casual conversational style. This higher quality of user utterances implies more substantial and accurate self-disclosure, supporting the effectiveness of a formal conversational style in health-related contexts."

            "experiment_process": "Four experiments were conducted to assess Directed Diversity: 1) A simulation study to evaluate its ability to select diverse prompts, 2) An ideation study to measure perceived diversity and effort in generating ideas, and 3) Validation studies using quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the creativity and diversity of generated ideas. The phrase embedding used the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and phrases were selected to maximize diversity based on distance in the embedding space.",

            "experiment_process": "Two experiments were carried out on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Study 1 measured user perceptions and likelihood of information disclosure, varying information by domain (health vs non-health) and sensitivity (sensitive vs non-sensitive) using hypothetical scenarios. Study 2 analyzed the quality of user utterances in actual interactions with a health chatbot using either a formal or casual conversational style. An objective measure of language formality was used to design the chatbot scripts.",
            "result_discussion": "Study 1 found users perceive a formal conversational style as more competent and appropriate for eliciting sensitive health information. Study 2 revealed that a formal conversational style elicits higher quality user utterances compared to a casual conversational style in a health context.",
