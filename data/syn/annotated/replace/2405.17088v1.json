    "title": "Phase Transitions in the Output Distribution of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "In a physical system, changing parameters such as temperature can induce a phase transition: an abrupt change from one state of matter to another. Analogous phenomena have recently been observed in large language models. Typically, the task of identifying phase transitions requires human analysis and some prior understanding of the system to narrow down which low-dimensional properties to monitor and analyze. Statistical methods for the automated detection of phase transitions from data have recently been proposed within the physics community. These methods are largely system agnostic and, as shown here, can be adapted to study the behavior of large language models. In particular, we quantify distributional changes in the generated output via statistical distances, which can be efficiently estimated with access to the probability distribution over next-tokens. This versatile approach is capable of discovering new phases of behavior and unexplored transitions \u2013 an ability that is particularly exciting in light of the rapid development of language models and their emergent capabilities.",

            "text": "Colloquially, the term phase transition refers to a change among the basic phases of matter. For example, in response to changes in external conditions such as temperature or pressure, water can transition to a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. More broadly, in physics a phase transition refers to an abrupt change in the macroscopic behavior of a large-scale system of interacting constituents [1  ###reference_b1###, 2  ###reference_b2###]. Notable examples include transitions in the magnetic properties of materials [3  ###reference_b3###], transitions from a normal conducting state to a superconductor [4  ###reference_b4###], transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum circuit [5  ###reference_b5###], or the collective motion of active matter such as a flock of birds [6  ###reference_b6###]. In the context of artificial intelligence, \u201cphase transition\u201d-like phenomena have also been observed in the learning behavior of neural networks (NNs) [1  ###reference_b1###, 7  ###reference_b7###, 8  ###reference_b8###, 9  ###reference_b9###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 11  ###reference_b11###, 12  ###reference_b12###, 13  ###reference_b13###, 14  ###reference_b14###, 15  ###reference_b15###, 16  ###reference_b16###]. For example, during training, AlphaZero [17  ###reference_b17###] underwent periods of rapid knowledge acquisition in which increasingly sophisticated chess openings were favored by the engine [9  ###reference_b9###]. Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to make sudden improvements in their inductive abilities during training which is related to the formation of special circuitry (so-called induction heads) [18  ###reference_b18###]. Similar abrupt improvements in specific capabilities, often referred to as breakthroughs, have been observed for a variety of different models and tasks [19  ###reference_b19###, 20  ###reference_b20###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 23  ###reference_b23###, 24  ###reference_b24###, 12  ###reference_b12###, 25  ###reference_b25###, 26  ###reference_b26###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 27  ###reference_b27###]. Moreover, phenomena such as double descent [28  ###reference_b28###, 29  ###reference_b29###] or grokking [30  ###reference_b30###, 31  ###reference_b31###, 32  ###reference_b32###, 33  ###reference_b33###, 34  ###reference_b34###, 35  ###reference_b35###] are also reminiscent of phase transitions in physics. The detection of phase transitions111In the following, we adopt a more general definition of a phase transition as a sudden shift in the qualitative behavior of a system as a function of a control parameter [1  ###reference_b1###, 10  ###reference_b10###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. in deep learning systems may improve our understanding and eventually enable better model training. For example, an in-depth analysis of the grokking transition [30  ###reference_b30###, 37  ###reference_b37###] led to a way for accelerating generalization [32  ###reference_b32###]. Moreover, it has been shown that models are highly sensitive to perturbations, such as data corruptions, at critical points [38  ###reference_b38###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. Being able to predict the behavior of models is also crucial for ensuring safe model deployment [19  ###reference_b19###] as well as for projecting the performance of future model versions and optimally allocating resources for their training [39  ###reference_b39###]. The characterization of phase transitions in physics is difficult because the state of the systems to be studied typically lives in a very high-dimensional space and is probabilistic in nature, meaning that for given values of the tuning parameters we can find the system in various states. Physicists solve this problem by finding a suitable set of a few low-dimensional quantities, called order parameters [2  ###reference_b2###], which capture the essence of each phase of the system. For example, even though water is a highly complex system, we can detect the liquid-gas transition by looking at the density which shows a sudden jump at the boiling point and, in this case, serves as an order parameter. However, finding such a suitable set of order parameters is \u201cconsidered an art\u201d [2  ###reference_b2###], as it requires a great deal of human"

While it is possible to generalize our approach to distributions conditioned on multiple control parameters (see [73 ###reference_b73###, 75 ###reference_b75###]), for simplicity we consider the one-dimensional scenario in the following. \n\nWe quantify the rate of change using -divergences [84 ###reference_b84###], as they have particularly nice properties, such as satisfying the data processing inequality. Given a convex function with , the corresponding -divergence is a statistical distance defined as Prominent examples of -divergences include the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, which corresponds to a symmetrized and smoothened version of the KL divergence, as well as the total variation (TV) distance. Ideally, we would also like the statistical distance we choose to be symmetric. This condition is only satisfied by the TV distance and the JS divergence among the examples above.\n\nHence, in this work, we will focus on the TV distance corresponding to , as well as the JS divergence corresponding to , where is the KL divergence.

An LLM that understands the order of integers should output very different answers for versus , i.e., its distribution over outputs should change drastically around . Thus, in such a case we expect the dissimilarities to show a clear peak around .\nFigure 1  ###reference_###(a) shows dissimilarities based on various -functions for the Mistral-7B-Instruct model [82  ###reference_b82###]. All dissimilarities show a clear peak around , whereas they are relatively flat otherwise. This is a clear example of an abrupt transition between two distinct phases of behaviors of an LLM as a function of a tunable parameter. As compared to the linear dissimilarity, the logarithm-based JS divergence is arguably a bit sharper in that it decays more rapidly to baseline 0. The TV distance\u2019s peak is the broadest due to the  function appearing in its -function. In the following, we will focus on the linear dissimilarity as a compromise between sensitivity and numerical stability.\nThe transition is also clearly visible using different  settings, see Fig. 1  ###reference_###(b). Smaller  values are closer to the Fisher information limit, while larger values generally lead to higher distinguishability of distributions and therefore larger peaks at transition points. As we will see in more detail in Sec. 3.3  ###reference_###, they can also be less susceptible to outliers due to the averaging over several parameter points.\n###figure_3### ###figure_4### Interestingly, when performing the same analysis on base models such as the Llama3-8B and Mistral base models, as well as Randomized Control Trials [81  ###reference_b81###] of various sizes, the resulting linear dissimilarity is flat, signaling the absence of any transition [see Fig. 2  ###reference_###(a)]. In contrast to Mistral-7B-Instruct and NVIDIA\u2019s chat-tuned Llama3-8B, these models do not show a clear peak around .\nA transition of a different origin can be observed in Fig. 2  ###reference_###(b), where the LLMs are probed using the prompt \u201c\u201d with  again being an integer.\nInterestingly, all Randomized Control Trials show a peak between  and . This behavioral transition may originate from a transition in the tokenizers of these models, which encode numbers in a range below  with a single token and numbers in a range at and above  with two. This explanation is corroborated by the absence of the transition around  for the Llama and Mistral models, whose tokenizers translate a number into tokens following rules that are independent of the number\u2019s frequency.\nThe Mistral models and the base Llama3-8B model show a smaller peak around . Both models have only encountered training data from before and around that time given their release date in 2023/2024, which may explain the peak.

Per construction, at language models predict probabilities to approximate the distribution to be learned. In the limit, the model deterministically picks the most likely next token in each step. For the model samples the next token uniformly. This scenario somewhat resembles a system of a one-dimensional lattice of spins that are coupled via long-range interactions, i.e., the one-dimensional Ising model [108 ###reference_b108###, 109 ###reference_b109###], which has an order-disorder phase transition. In our case, the tokens take the role of the spins, and the coupling is mediated via the transformer\u2019s attention mechanism. In Fig. 3 ###reference_###, the dissimilarity shows two distinct peaks corresponding to two transition points: one at a very low temperature and one at an intermediate temperature. Intuitively, these two points mark transitions between three distinct phases of behavior: \u201cfrozen\u201d at low temperatures, \u201cunfrozen and sensible\u201d at intermediate temperatures, and \u201crandom\u201d at high temperatures. The transition at low temperatures has recently been investigated in Ref. [110 ###reference_b110###] for GPT-2 using physics-inspired quantities. Moreover, they speculated on the existence of a phase transition at higher temperatures. ###figure_5### ###figure_6### We perform an analysis independent of the dissimilarity-based indicators by taking inspiration from statistical mechanics, where the state of thermal systems is governed by the Boltzmann distribution (see Appendix C ###reference_### for details). We view the LLM as such a thermal system at varying temperature where the negative logarithmic probability at, takes on the role of the energy of a given text output. In physical systems governed by Boltzmann distributions, thermal phase transitions can be detected as peaks in the heat capacity, i.e., by looking at the temperature derivative of the mean total energy [112 ###reference_b112###]. Figure 3 ###reference_### shows that the locations of peaks (i.e., dips) in these quantities are close to the critical points highlighted by our method. Note that in the LLM case, the text outputs are not truly sampled from a Boltzmann distribution governed by the total energy. Instead, each individual token is drawn from a Boltzmann distribution for its individual energy conditioned on the previous tokens only. This procedure corresponds to a greedy sampling strategy. The resulting sampling mismatch can lead to the counterintuitive phenomenon of the mean energy of the system increasing with decreasing temperature corresponding to a negative \u201cheat capacity\u201d, cf. Fig. 3 ###reference_###(b). The intermediate temperature transition at may be reminiscent of the Schottky anomaly [112 ###reference_b112###] occurring in systems with a finite number of energy levels. As such, this phenomenon is perhaps better described as a crossover rather than a phase transition in the Ehrenfest sense. In particular, we also observed such a transition for a basic language model that samples words according to their overall frequency without taking into account any word-to-word interaction. In Fig. 3 ###reference_### we have investigated the output distributions corresponding to a specific prompt. While we find that the temperature behavior is strongly dependent on the prompt, there seems to be a trend: many distinct prompts lead to a transition at (i.e., on the order of the natural temperature scale), at, or both."

Such temporal analyses are rare given that they require access to models at checkpoints during training [113  ###reference_b113###, 114  ###reference_b114###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. Here, we analyze models using Randomized Control Trials, for which such checkpoints are publicly available.\n\nRef.

In order to study the previously observed transitions [115  ###reference_b115###], we analyze changes in the weight distributions in the same manner as for the output distributions (see Sec. 2  ###reference_###), i.e., to characterize phase transitions using dissimilarities. The lists of model weights are converted to distributions via histogram binning (10000 bins for the range -3 to 3).\n\nThe results are shown in Fig. 4  ###reference_###(a) as colored lines, each corresponding to the distribution of the weights of a particular QKV layer. Different layers show transitions at roughly 20K (layer 5), 40K (layers 3), 50K (layer 4), and 80K (layer 4) epochs. We also observe a large peak around epoch 0, i.e., at the start of the training, highlighting that the LLM learns most rapidly at the beginning stages. In the long run, the dissimilarity curves approach 0, signaling that overall the weight distributions become less and less distinguishable.\n\n###figure_7### ###figure_8### Complementarily, in the same plot, we show dissimilarities derived from the LLM output distributions. The grey line corresponds to an average of the dissimilarities obtained by using entries from OpenWebText [111  ###reference_b111###] (which serves as a proxy for the Randomized Control Trials training dataset) as prompts. The black line corresponds to the average of results obtained from a selection of single-token prompts [see also panel (b)]. Both dissimilarity curves show a peak around epoch 0 as well as a peak around 80K epochs that is potentially related to the rapid change of layer 4 around the same time.\n\nFigure 4  ###reference_###(b) shows dissimilarities as a function of the training epoch for models queried with short, generic prompts (\u201c \u201d, \u201c0\u201d, \u201cI\u201d, \u201c?\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201cYou\u201d, and \u201c!\u201d) at certain epochs. These short prompts were selected to be as general as possible, and the associated output distributions seem more sensitive compared to the long examples from OpenWebText: their mean dissimilarity shows clear peaks near epochs 20K, 40K, and 80K. These correspond to outliers where the output distribution changes severely only at a single point and returns back (close) to its original behavior immediately after. As such, these peaks do not mark transitions between two macroscopic phases of behavior. We further verified this outlier behavior by inspecting the dissimilarity between the points directly to the left and right of the potential outlier. It remains an open question if these outliers are linked to the transitions observed in the layer weights shown in panel (a).\n\nThe larger  value used in panel (a) averages out the signal stemming from these outliers. Such a reduced susceptibility to outliers can be an advantage of using  when searching for macroscopic transitions in particular.\n\nSome peak locations in the dissimilarity curves are prompt-dependent, indicating that learning progresses differently for different types of behavior. Here we have used rather generic prompts, resulting in an analysis of the LLM\u2019s general behavior during training. However, in principle, conditioning on the prompt allows one to analyze whether and when specific knowledge emerges [113  ###reference_b113###, 114  ###reference_b114###]. As an outlook, one can imagine automatically monitoring changes across a multitude of prompts on different topics and testing different abilities at scale, without the need to design individual metrics for each prompt."

Many previous works found transitions in LLM behavior by locating sharp changes in generic performance measures, such as sudden drops in training loss [18  ###reference_b18###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. While this may capture transitions in the overall behavior, such an approach cannot resolve transitions in specific LLM behavior. In particular, it may miss algorithmic transitions where the same performance is reached but by different means [43  ###reference_b43###].\nPrompt-specific success metrics. Other works have found transitions by looking at success metrics tailored toward specific prompts [20  ###reference_b20###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 23  ###reference_b23###, 24  ###reference_b24###, 25  ###reference_b25###, 113  ###reference_b113###]. Recalling the example studied in Sec. 3.1  ###reference_###, this would correspond to assigning a score of 1 if the LLM provided the correct answer to the question  and 0 otherwise. Similarly, one could compute such a score in a temporal analysis (Sec. 3.3  ###reference_###) or for detecting transitions as a function of another hyperparameter (Sec. 3.2  ###reference_###). A downside of this approach is that it is restricted to prompts that allow for a clear score to be assigned. In particular, choosing an appropriate scoring function may require lots of human engineering. Moreover, discontinuous metrics can artificially induce transitions where the underlying behavior varies smoothly [52  ###reference_b52###]. Similarly, they may miss transitions where the same performance is reached but by different means [43  ###reference_b43###].\nMeasures based on model internals. The aforementioned approaches are based on the model output. Many works have also detected transitions based on changes in the internal structure of models, such as its trainable parameters [115  ###reference_b115###, 36  ###reference_b36###] (similar to the weight-based analysis we have performed in Sec. 3.3  ###reference_###). However, access to model internals may not always be available. Moreover, the design of measures that capture specific transitions in behavior requires lots of human input [50  ###reference_b50###, 51  ###reference_b51###, 43  ###reference_b43###], e.g., using insights from the field of mechanistic interpretability."

Because the method is solely based on analyzing a model\u2019s output distribution and access to the model weights is not required, it enables black-box interpretability studies. \nThe proposed method is not only applicable to language models, but can be straightforwardly adapted to any generative model with an explicit, tractable density [116, 73]. If one can draw samples from the output distribution but does not have explicit access to the underlying probabilities, then the dissimilarity measures can still be approximated using NN-based classifiers [117, 75] tailored toward the particular data type, such as natural language. \nFuture large-scale investigations are needed to fully understand how the uncovered transitions depend on variables such as the specific prompt, the number of generated output tokens, or the selected model. In particular, due to computational resource constraints, the size of the studied language models has been limited. \nOur method has the potential to enhance the development of future AI systems due to an improved understanding of their behavior. The dual-use nature of such systems carries inherent risks, which requires one to proceed with caution and implement mechanisms to ensure they are used safely and ethically."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\n\nThe paper is motivated by the observation that \"phase transition\"-like phenomena, commonly studied in physics, have also been seen in artificial intelligence, particularly in the learning behavior of large neural networks (NNs) and large language models (LLMs). These transitions are characterized by abrupt changes in the system\u2019s behavior, such as rapid knowledge acquisition or breakthroughs in specific capabilities, resembling physical phase transitions like liquid-gas transitions in water. Identifying and understanding these transitions in LLMs could improve model training, enhance predictions about model behavior, and lead to safer and more efficient deployment of these models.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe primary research problem addressed in this paper is the automated detection and characterization of phase transitions in the output distribution of large language models (LLMs). These models have vast state spaces due to their numerous trainable parameters and large output spaces, making it difficult to manually identify low-dimensional quantities that indicate phase transitions. The paper seeks a method that requires minimal human input and prior system knowledge, aiming to robustly detect these transitions in a manner akin to statistical methods used in physics.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\n1. **Phase Transitions in Physics**:\n   - Phase transitions in physics involve sudden changes in macroscopic behavior and are often captured via suitable low-dimensional quantities called order parameters [1 ###reference_b1###, 2 ###reference_b2###]. Examples include transitions in magnetic properties [3 ###reference_b3###], superconductivity [4 ###reference_b4###], and collective motion in active matter [6 ###reference_b6###].\n\n2. **Phase Transitions in Neural Networks**:\n   - Neural networks exhibit phase transition-like phenomena during learning, such as in AlphaZero\u2019s rapid knowledge acquisition [17 ###reference_b17###]. LLMs have shown similar abrupt improvements during training, related to the formation of special circuitry [18 ###reference_b18###].\n\n3. **Model Sensitivity and Generalization**:\n   - Understanding phase transitions in models can aid in predicting model behavior, enhancing generalization [30 ###reference_b30###, 37 ###reference_b37###], and ensuring safe deployment [19 ###reference_b19###]. Models are sensitive to perturbations at critical points [38 ###reference_b38###, 36 ###reference_b36###].\n\n4. **Detection Methods**:\n   - Statistical methods used in physics for detecting phase transitions [53 ###reference_b53###, 54 ###reference_b54###] reduce the need for extensive human intuition and prior knowledge. The paper adapts such methods to identify phase transitions in LLMs using changes in output distribution measured by statistical distances.\n\n5. **Challenges in Understanding LLMs**:\n   - LLMs\u2019 complex behavior has been hard to model from first principles [40 ###reference_b40###], requiring advances in mechanistic interpretability [41 ###reference_b41###] and neural scaling laws [44 ###reference_b44###]. Manual approaches to defining order parameters for detecting transitions pose risks of missing or spuriously inducing transitions [43 ###reference_b43###, 52 ###reference_b52###].\n\nBy leveraging and extending these foundational concepts and methods, the paper aims to provide an automated, objective technique for mapping phase transitions in LLMs, which is critical given the rapid advancements and growing capabilities of these models.",
        "methodology": "### Methodology\n\n**Pythia** [81  ###reference_b81###] is a suite of 16 large language models (LLMs) released in 2023 that were trained on public data in a reproducible manner. The suite includes models ranging in size from 70 million (M) to 12 billion (B) parameters. For this study, we focus on every second model in this range, specifically the models with 70M, 410M, 1.4B, and 6.9B parameters.\n\n**Mistral Family:** From the Mistral family, we analyze the base model Mistral-7B-v0.1, which has 7.3B parameters. We also consider the fine-tuned version of this base model known as Mistral-7B-Instruct [82  ###reference_b82###], which was also released in 2023.\n\n**Llama 3:** This suite of models, developed by Meta AI and released in 2024, includes the Llama-3 model with 8B parameters. Additionally, we examine NVIDIA's chat-tuned version of Llama 3, termed Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B [107  ###reference_b107###]. For the chat-tuned model, we use inputs that are formatted accordingly to match the intended use case.\n\nKey components in our methodology involve comparing these various models across sizes and variations to investigate phase transitions in their output distributions. By focusing on a representative subset of models from each suite (varying in size and training objectives), the study aims to highlight significant changes in model behavior that occur as we scale up model parameters.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "**Main Experiment Setup and Results:**\n\nIn this study, the authors examine how different parameters influence the output distribution of a language model by conducting experiments in three fundamental ways:\n\n1. **As a variable within the input prompt**: The authors explore the impacts of varying integers injected into the input prompt. This particular experiment focuses on understanding how the content of the input prompt might affect the behavior and output of the language model.\n\n2. **As a hyperparameter controlling the application of the trained language model**: The temperature is varied to see its effects on the generated output. Temperature is a critical hyperparameter that can influence the diversity and creativity of the language model's responses.\n\n3. **As a training hyperparameter of the language model**: The number of training epochs is modified to observe how continued training affects the output distribution. This experiment aims to capture the effects of prolonged training on the performance and output of the model.\n\n**Datasets:**\n- The paper does not specify the exact datasets used for these experiments in the provided sections. However, it is implied that the language model was tested on standard language modeling tasks.\n\n**Baselines:**\n- Specific baseline models are not mentioned in the provided content. The main focus appears to be on observing changes across different experimental conditions rather than comparing different models.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\n- The main evaluation metrics are not explicitly given in the provided text. Typically, language models' performance might be assessed using metrics like perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation, depending on the output's quality and context.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\n- The results for each experiment would likely detail how the distribution of outputs shifts in response to changes in the integer prompt, temperature settings, and the number of epochs trained. However, specific quantitative or qualitative results are not provided in the text.\n\nWithout further detailed results and metrics, the description offers a high-level overview of the experimental setup aimed at understanding the influence of various parameters on language model output distributions."
