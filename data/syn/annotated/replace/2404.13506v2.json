Traditional fine-tuning methods, involving adjustments to all parameters, face challenges due to high computational and memory demands. This has led to the development of Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which selectively update parameters to balance computational efficiency with performance. This review examines PEFT approaches, offering a detailed comparison of various strategies highlighting applications across different domains, including text generation, medical imaging, protein modeling, and speech synthesis. By assessing the effectiveness of PEFT methods in reducing computational load, speeding up training, and lowering memory usage, this paper contributes to making deep learning more accessible and adaptable, facilitating its wider application and encouraging innovation in model optimization.

(2020  ###reference_b39###), etc.) consist of billions, if not trillions (especially in case of mixture-of-experts architectures), of parameters. Traditional fine-tuning methods involve adjusting all model parameters to fit the new task or dataset, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. This approach is often referred to as \u201dfull fine-tuning\u201d Lv et al. (2023  ###reference_b31###). Full fine-tuning requires a large amount of data and computational resources to converge Mohammadi and Chapon (2020  ###reference_b32###), which can be a limitation for tasks with limited data availability or computational budgets. Additionally, fine-tuning all parameters often lead to over-fitting, especially when the new task has limited data.\nAnother limitation of traditional fine-tuning methods is that they do not leverage the knowledge gained during pre-training Han et al. (2024  ###reference_b17###). Pre-trained models are typically trained on large datasets and have learned general features that are useful across multiple tasks. Full fine-tuning discards this knowledge and starts from scratch (e.g., Korbak et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###)), which can lead to sub-optimal performance.\nFinally, traditional fine-tuning methods can result in catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets the knowledge learned during pre-training Chen et al. (2020  ###reference_b9###). This can lead to poor performance on both the new task and the original task, making it difficult to achieve good performance across multiple tasks. These limitations have led researchers to explore PEFT methods that can address these issues. PEFT allows to only fine-tune a small number of model parameters while freezing most of the parameters of the pre-trained LLM. PEFT has the following advantages: (i) reduced computational costs (requires fewer GPUs and GPU time); (ii) faster training times (finishes training faster); (iii) lower hardware requirements (works with cheaper GPUs with less VRAM); (iv) better modeling performance (reduces over-fitting); and (v) less storage (majority of weights can be shared across different tasks)."

(2024  ###reference_b50###). The paper presents a specific variant of ReFT, dubbed Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), which modifies the model\u2019s internal representations and exhibits far greater parameter efficiency, with improvements by factors of 10 to 50 compared to contemporary PEFT methods. The foundational mechanism of the LoReFT framework, is defined by the Distributed Interchange Intervention (DII) formula . Wu et al. (2024  ###reference_b50###) employ the projection matrix R to refine the hidden states b, steering them toward a target state s. This method is crafted to subtly yet efficiently influence the model\u2019s output, guiding it towards desired behaviors or responses. Extensive evaluations conducted by the authors on various reasoning tasks and benchmarks such as Alpaca-Eval v1.0 and GLUE indicated that LoReFT not only achieves better efficiency but also superior performance relative to leading PEFT approaches over different datasets in their respective categories. LoReFT achieved state-of-the-art performance for commonsense reasoning, surpassing other methods such as Prefix Tuning Bisk et al. (2019 ###reference_b5###), Adapter-based methods, and LoRA, particularly on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B models. LoReFT showed an accuracy improvement, averaging an 80.2% and 83.3% across different datasets BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaS., WinoG., ARC-e, ARC-c, OBQA, for the Llama 7B and 13B models respectively. See specific results from the paper in Table 1. \n\nThe MNIST dataset is widely used for image processing systems, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. The dataset is composed of handwritten digits and provides a straightforward task for evaluating algorithms. The performance of the LoReFT in arithmetic reasoning Hu et al. (2023 ###reference_b20###) tasks is found to be inferior to that of LoRA and adapters, though it surpasses prefix-tuning. The analysis indicates that LoReFT may encounter more challenges in chain-of-thought reasoning as opposed to single-step commonsense reasoning tasks. This difficulty is attributed to the extended length of generations, which diminishes the efficacy of the intervention, and the inherent complexity of the task. Additionally, the paper revealed that LoReFT demonstrates improved performance with the 13B model compared to the 7B model, suggesting scalability of LoReFT with increased model size.

This area looks into finding videos based on text descriptions and creating captions for videos, which is key for making sense of what's happening in a video just by looking at the words linked to it. Fang et al. introduce the Alignment and Generation Adapter (AGAdapter) for enhancing video-text understanding Fang et al. (2023  ###reference_b14###). This integrates a knowledge-sharing alignment adapter with a large language model for video-text retrieval and video captioning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MSR-VTT and ActivityNet benchmarks. Their research introduces a novel approach to video-text understanding by integrating the pre-trained CLIP model (CLIP-bigG/14) for encoding and the LLaMA-7B model for language processing, alongside KaAdapter and Pg Adapter for efficient adaptation. These components work together within a robust tech stack that optimizes video and text alignment across various datasets, including MSR-VTT and ActivityNet, tailored with video and caption lengths set to dataset-specific requirements. Numerical results from an ablation study on the MSR-VTT dataset reveal the AGAdapter\u2019s efficacy, particularly when augmented with LIcap, showcasing remarkable enhancements in video-text retrieval and video captioning metrics compared to the CLIP-finetuned baseline. These outcomes underscore the method's success in delivering significant performance uplifts within minimal training times (0.12 to 0.5 hours), affirming its potential in advancing video-text comprehension tasks with high efficiency and effectiveness.\nSimilarly, the KAdaptation method, achieves a trade-off between accuracy and parameter efficiency in the vision transformer (ViT-B-224/32) through CLIP pretraining He et al.

Evaluated across 20 datasets from the ELEVATER benchmark, this approach notably excels by updating merely 0.09 percent of the model\u2019s parameters, underscoring its efficiency.

Ultimately, our objective is to support the democratization of deep learning, fostering its broader application across various fields and devices.\n\n---\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe primary motivation for this paper stems from the high computational and memory demands associated with fine-tuning deep learning models for specific tasks or datasets.

        "methodology": "The proposed method, Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), innovatively addresses the computational and performance limitations associated with traditional fine-tuning of large pre-trained models (such as BERT, GPT, T5). Here's an in-depth look at the method and its key components:\n\n### Key Components and Innovations\n\n1. **Selective Parameter Tuning**:\n   Instead of adjusting all model parameters, PEFT involves fine-tuning only a small subset of the parameters while keeping the majority of the pre-trained model's parameters fixed. This selective tuning capitalizes on the general features learned during pre-training, mitigating the risk of overfitting and preventing the model from discarding useful, pre-learned knowledge.\n\n2. **Reduced Computational Costs**:\n   By fine-tuning fewer parameters, the computational resources required for training are significantly reduced. This includes lower GPU time and the need for fewer GPUs, making the process more feasible and cost-effective, particularly in resource-constrained environments.\n\n3. **Faster Training Times**:\n   Due to the smaller number of parameters requiring adjustment, the training process not only becomes less computationally intensive but also completes in a shorter time span. This expedited process enables quicker iterations and faster deployment of models.\n\n4. **Lower Hardware Requirements**:\n   The method is designed to work efficiently with less powerful and cheaper GPUs that have less VRAM. This democratizes access to fine-tuning powerful models, as organizations and researchers can employ more affordable hardware without compromising on performance.\n\n5. **Improved Modeling Performance**:\n   By reducing the risk of overfitting and ensuring that essential pre-trained knowledge is retained, PEFT can enhance performance on the new task. Additionally, it alleviates issues of catastrophic forgetting, thereby maintaining a balance between learning new tasks and retaining performance on the original pre-trained tasks.\n\n6. **Efficient Storage**:\n   Since most of the model parameters remain unchanged and can be shared across different tasks, PEFT necessitates less storage space. This efficiency is particularly beneficial when managing multiple models for various tasks, allowing for simpler and more flexible model deployment.\n\n### Summary of Advantages\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Leveraging selective tuning significantly lowers the computational demands compared to full fine-tuning.\n- **Faster Training**: The reduced parameter space translates to quicker convergence times.\n- **Lower Hardware Costs**: Works with more affordable GPUs, making the method accessible to a broader audience.\n- **Enhanced Performance**: Maintains a fine balance between new task learning and retention of pre-learned knowledge, improving overall performance.\n- **Storage Optimization**: Less storage required as the majority of the model parameters remain reusable across different tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, PEFT offers a robust and efficient approach to fine-tuning large language models by addressing the limitations of computational cost, resource availability, and overfitting associated with traditional fine-tuning methods.",
