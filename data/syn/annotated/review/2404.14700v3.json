    "title": "FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural.\nThe generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation.\nOur experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling.\nAudio samples can be found in https://flashspeech.github.io/.",

            "text": "###figure_1### In recent years, the landscape of speech synthesis has been transformed by the advent of large-scale generative models. Consequently, the latest research efforts have achieved notable advancements in zero-shot speech synthesis systems by significantly increasing the size of both datasets and models.\nZero-shot speech synthesis, such as text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC) and Editing, aims to generate speech that incorporates unseen speaker characteristics from a reference audio segment during inference, without the need for additional training. Current advanced zero-shot speech synthesis systems typically leverage language models (LMs) Wang et al. (2023a  ###reference_b60###); Yang et al. (2023  ###reference_b64###); Zhang et al. (2023  ###reference_b67###); Kharitonov et al. (2023  ###reference_b21###); Wang et al. (2023b  ###reference_b62###); Peng et al. (2024  ###reference_b40###); Kim et al. (2024  ###reference_b23###) and diffusion-style models Shen et al. (2024  ###reference_b53###); Kim et al. (2023b  ###reference_b24###); Le et al. (2023  ###reference_b27###); Jiang et al. (2023b  ###reference_b19###) for in-context speech generation on the large-scale dataset. However, the generation process of these methods needs a long-time iteration. For example, VALL-E Wang et al. (2023a  ###reference_b60###) builds on the language model to predict 75 audio token sequences for a 1-second speech, in its first-stage autoregressive (AR) token sequence generation. When using a non-autoregressive (NAR) latent diffusion model Rombach et al. (2022  ###reference_b48###) based framework,\nNaturalSpeech 2 Shen et al. (2024  ###reference_b53###) still requires 150 sampling steps.\nAs a result, although these methods can produce human-like speech, they require significant computational time and cost. Some efforts have been made to accelerate the generation process. Voicebox Le et al. (2023  ###reference_b27###) adopts flow-matching Lipman et al. (2022  ###reference_b30###) so that fewer sampling steps (NFE111NFE: number of function evaluations.: 64) can be achieved because of the optimal transport path. ClaM-TTS Kim et al. (2024  ###reference_b23###) proposes a mel-codec with a superior compression rate and a latent language model that generates a stack of tokens at once.\nAlthough the slow generation speed issue has been somewhat alleviated, the inference speed is still far from satisfactory for practical applications.\nMoreover, the substantial computational time of these approaches leads to significant computational cost overheads, presenting another challenge.\nThe fundamental limitation of speech generation stems from the intrinsic mechanisms of language models and diffusion models, which require considerable time either auto-regressively or through a large number of denoising steps. Hence, the primary objective of this work is to accelerate inference speed and reduce computational costs while preserving generation quality at levels comparable to the prior research.\nIn this paper, we propose FlashSpeech as the next step towards efficient zero-shot speech synthesis. To address the challenge of slow generation speed, we leverage the latent consistency model (LCM) Luo et al. (2023  ###reference_b33###), a recent advancement in generative models. Building upon the previous non-autoregressive TTS system Shen et al. (2024  ###reference_b53###), we adopt the encoder of a neural audio codec to convert speech waveforms into latent vectors as the training target for our LCM. To train this model, we propose a novel technique called adversarial consistency training, which utilizes the capabilities of pre-trained speech language models Chen et al. (2022b  ###reference_b7###); Hsu et al. (2021  ###reference_b12###); Baevski et al. (2020  ###reference_b2###) as discriminators. This facilitates the transfer of knowledge from large pre-trained speech language models to speech generation tasks, efficiently integrating adversarial and consistency training to improve performance. The LCM is conditioned on prior vectors obtained from a phoneme encoder, a prompt encoder, and a prosody generator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed prosody generator leads to more diverse expressions and prosody while preserving stability.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\nWe propose FlashSpeech, an efficient zero-shot speech synthesis system that generates voice with high audio quality and speaker similarity in zero-shot scenarios.\nWe introduce adversarial consistency training, a novel combination of consistency and adversarial training leveraging pre-trained speech language models, for training the latent consistency model from scratch, achieving speech generation in one or two steps.\nWe propose a prosody generator module that enhances the diversity of prosody while maintaining stability.\nFlashSpeech significantly outperforms strong baselines in audio quality and matches them in speaker similarity. Remarkably, it achieves this at a speed approximately 20 times faster than comparable systems, demonstrating unprecedented efficiency."

We adopt a consistency model as a prosody refinement module. The conditional feature of the consistency model is the feature from prosody regression before the final projection layer. Thus, the residual from a stochastic sampler refines\nthe output of a deterministic prosody regression and produces a diverse set of plausible prosody under the same transcription and audio prompt.\nOne option for the final prosody output  can be represented as:\nwhere  denotes the final prosody output,\n represents the residual output from the prosody refinement module, capturing the variations between the ground truth prosody and the deterministic prediction,\n is the initial deterministic prosody prediction from the prosody regression module.\nHowever, this formulation may negatively affect prosody stability, a similar observation is found in Vyas et al.

(2022  ###reference_b50###) is a Speech MOS predictor666https://github.com/tarepan/SpeechMOS to measure the naturalness of speech. We use it in ablation studies which reduced the cost for evaluation.\nProsody JS Divergence:\nTo evaluate the diversity and accuracy of the prosody prediction in our TTS system, we include the Prosody JS Divergence metric. This metric employs the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence Men\u00e9ndez et al. (1997  ###reference_b36###) to quantify the divergence between the predicted and ground truth prosody feature distributions. Prosody features, including pitch, and duration, are quantized and their distributions in both synthesized and natural speech are compared. Lower JS divergence values indicate closer similarity between the predicted prosody features and those of the ground truth, suggesting a higher diversity of the synthesized speech."

        "research_background": "Based on the provided introduction, the paper's main elements can be articulated as follows:\n\n### Motivation\nThe motivation behind the paper is rooted in the limitations of current advanced zero-shot speech synthesis systems. Although these systems, which include text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and editing, have achieved significant progress by leveraging large-scale generative models, they suffer from lengthy generation times and high computational costs. The primary driver is the intrinsic mechanisms of the language and diffusion models, which require extensive iterative processes, either autoregressively or through numerous denoising steps. These issues hinder the practical application of zero-shot speech synthesis systems despite their ability to produce high-quality, human-like speech.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe research problem focuses on enhancing the efficiency of zero-shot speech synthesis systems. Specifically, it's about accelerating inference speed and reducing computational costs without compromising the quality of the generated speech. The goal is to develop a system that maintains high audio quality and speaker similarity while vastly improving inference speed to make these systems more feasible for practical applications.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\nKey contributions from prior research that contextualize this work include:\n1. **Language Models and Diffusion Models**: Systems like VALL-E (Wang et al., 2023a) and NaturalSpeech 2 (Shen et al., 2024) utilize language models and non-autoregressive (NAR) latent diffusion models for speech synthesis but suffer from long iteration times.\n2. **Acceleration Techniques**: Efforts like Voicebox (Le et al., 2023), which uses optimal transport paths to reduce sampling steps, and ClaM-TTS (Kim et al., 2024), which employs a mel-codec and latent language model for token generation, have made strides in improving speed but still fall short of practical requirements.\n3. **Neural Audio Codecs**: Building on neural audio codecs for converting speech waveforms into latent vectors (Shen et al., 2024).\n4. **Pre-trained Speech Language Models**: Utilizing pre-trained speech language models (Chen et al., 2022b; Hsu et al., 2021; Baevski et al., 2020) for tasks such as discrimination, facilitating knowledge transfer and improving generation performance.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nTo address the identified challenges, the paper introduces FlashSpeech, an efficient zero-shot speech synthesis system that:\n- Utilizes a latent consistency model (LCM) to achieve rapid speech generation.\n- Leverages adversarial consistency training, a novel method that combines consistency and adversarial training with pre-trained speech language models to improve speech generation performance.\n- Incorporates a prosody generator to produce diverse and stable prosody in the synthesized speech.\n\n### Contributions\nThe paper emphasizes that FlashSpeech achieves an unprecedented level of efficiency, generating high-quality and speaker-similar audio approximately 20 times faster than current leading systems. This demonstrates a significant advancement towards practical zero-shot speech synthesis applications.",
        "methodology": "In order to provide an accurate description of the proposed method or model from the methodology section of the paper \"FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis,\" I would need specific details from the actual text of the section referenced. However, based on the title \"FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis,\" the methodology likely involves a novel approach to synthesizing speech in a way that does not require prior exposure to the specific voice being synthesized (zero-shot). This suggests the method employs techniques that generalize well to new, unseen voices without additional training. Key components and innovations might include: - A neural network architecture optimized for speech synthesis. - A training process utilizing massive datasets to generalize well across various voices. - Techniques for efficient computation to ensure quick response times. Without concrete excerpts, a general assumption would be: 1. **Model Architecture**: Descriptions of any specific neural network models, such as sequence-to-sequence models, convolutional neural networks, or transformers specifically adapted for the speech synthesis task. 2. **Data Preparation and Processing**: Steps involved in pre-processing audio data to train the model effectively, possibly including feature extraction techniques like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). 3. **Training Mechanism**: Information on how the model is trained in a way that supports zero-shot learning, perhaps by incorporating adversarial training, variational autoencoders, or other state-of-the-art techniques. 4. **Inference Pipeline**: Explanation of how the trained model is used to generate speech from text in real-time or near-real-time scenarios. To provide an accurate description, it would be best to have the actual wording from the methodology section or a detailed caption. Please provide more text or details!",

We compare our proposed FlashSpeech model against these existing baselines to establish our model's efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n#### Evaluation Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of the TTS models, we employ several standard metrics:\n1. **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)** - used to assess the naturalness and overall quality of the synthesized speech as perceived by human listeners.\n2. **Character Error Rate (CER)** - quantifies the accuracy of the generated speech text compared to the reference text. It identifies insertion, deletion, and substitution errors.\n3. **Speaker Similarity** - measures how closely the synthesized voice matches the target speaker's voice using similarity scores.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n\nFlashSpeech outperforms existing zero-shot TTS models across several key metrics. \n\n1. **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**: Our model achieves a higher MOS, indicating that listeners perceive the speech synthesized by FlashSpeech to be more natural and of higher quality compared to other models.\n2. **Character Error Rate (CER)**: FlashSpeech demonstrates lower CER, showing its capability to generate speech that closely matches the intended text with fewer errors.\n3. **Speaker Similarity**: The similarity scores reveal that our model excels in maintaining the characteristics of the target speaker's voice, outperforming the baseline models in preserving speaker identity.\n\nAdditionally, our qualitative results, showcased on our demo page, highlight the speech editing and diverse speech sampling capabilities of FlashSpeech, further reinforcing the model's robustness and adaptability to different speech synthesis scenarios."
