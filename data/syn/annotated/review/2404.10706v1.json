    "title": "Cross-Language Evolution of Divergent Collective Memory Around the Arab Spring",
    "abstract": "The Arab Spring was a historic set of protests beginning in 2011 that toppled governments and led to major conflicts. Collective memories of events like these can vary significantly across social contexts in response to political, cultural, and linguistic factors. While Wikipedia plays an important role in documenting both historic and current events, little attention has been given to how Wikipedia articles, created in the aftermath of major events, continue to evolve over years or decades. Using the archived content of Arab Spring-related topics across the Arabic and English Wikipedias between 2011 and 2024,\nwe define and evaluate multilingual measures of event salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory surrounding the Arab Spring. Our findings about the temporal evolution of the Wikipedia articles\u2019 content similarity across languages has implications for theorizing about online collective memory processes and evaluating linguistic models trained on these data.",

            "text": "Collective memory is the communal act of sense-making that results in community based perspectives of the past (Halbwachs 1992  ###reference_b10###; Zubrzycki and Wo\u017any 2020  ###reference_b27###). It is difficult to study empirically across linguistic and cultural contexts due to diverse evidence and sense-making processes. Wikipedia has become a test case, a \u201cglobal memory place\u201d, to understand and compare the emergence and evolution of collective memory processes (Pentzold 2009  ###reference_b21###; Yasseri, Gildersleve, and David 2022  ###reference_b26###). As a test case, the Arab Spring is major demonstration of internet mediated collective action that spanned across linguistic barriers and has become a salient case study to understand collective memory on Wikipedia (Ferron and Massa 2011a  ###reference_b5###, b  ###reference_b6###; Al-Shehari and Al-Sharafi 2022  ###reference_b2###)\nThere are no requirements that different Wikipedia language editions have identical or even similar content about a topic. Because the content of each edit made to Wikipedia articles are stored in revision histories that can be retrieved and analyzed, it is possible to retrieve and compare across historical versions of articles. Researchers can leverage this temporal variation in article content within and across languages to identify the emergence of consensus perspectives, conflicts, and other processes associated with the construction and contestation of collective memory processes (Ford 2022  ###reference_b8###). This paper examines the construction of collective memory on Arabic and English Wikipedia articles about the events related to the 2011 Arab Spring by focusing on the use of two types of links within articles. The first type of links are \u201coutlinks\u201d from one article to another (also known as \u201cblue links\u201d) that are strong signals of similarity between articles based on editors\u2019 judgments of relevance and context.111https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\u02d9of\u02d9Style/Linking\nThe second type of links are inter-lingual links (ILL) identifying similar topics in other language editions.222https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage\u02d9links\nThis paper compares these links between articles across languages to detect what is introduced (or removed) and when as proxies for collective memory processes.\nThis paper contributes to two related empirical literatures using Wikipedia data. The first contribution is the study of different Wikipedia language editions by comparing their structure (Porter, Krafft, and Keegan 2020  ###reference_b22###; Hickman et al. 2021  ###reference_b15###; Adar, Skinner, and Weld 2009  ###reference_b1###; He et al. 2018  ###reference_b12###; Dandala, Mihalcea, and Bunescu 2012  ###reference_b4###), content (Hecht and Gergle 2010  ###reference_b14###; Roy, Bhatia, and Jain 2022  ###reference_b24###; Massa and Scrinzi 2012  ###reference_b20###), and collaboration practices like deliberation (Hale 2014  ###reference_b11###). This literature is often focused on macroscopic patterns involving the entire project and comparisons at a particular point in time instead of more situated cases or the evolution of content. The second contribution uses Wikipedia data to understand collective memory processes (Twyman, Keegan, and Shaw 2017  ###reference_b25###; Luyt 2016  ###reference_b19###; Ferron and Massa 2014  ###reference_b7###). This literature is often focused on the collaborations and content in the days and weeks immediately following major events rather than collective memory processes that may unfold over years or decades. To address each of these limitations, we focus on a sample of articles related to the events of the 2011 Arab Spring that unfolded over 13 years ago to characterize and compare the \u201cafterlives\u201d of content about major historical events.\nThis paper presents an ensemble of quantitative methods to develop a grounded understanding of four behaviors related to collective memory formation: salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation.\nThe Arab Spring is what revolutionized our understanding of contemporary collective action. Our more complex definition of collective memory analyzing the Arab Spring summary page in English and Arabic, will allow a more thorough understanding of the entire collective memory process that is presented on Wikipedia.\nTo analyze the salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory around the Arab Spring we identified four questions to motivate our work:\nIs the concept salient through the time period in question, pointing to a continuing collective memory process?\nThrough analysis of size and number of outlinks, we find that the Arab Spring is a salient across languages from 2011 until early 2024 (present).\nAre results of varying deliberation processes across languages, creating divergent perspectives on the Wikipedia articles?\nBy clustering outlinks by their temporal inclusion, we find there are varying deliberation processes that are highlighted through previously latent inclusion themes we label, \u2019Stable\u2019, \u2019Debated\u2019, and \u2019Forgotten\u2019.\nHow similar are the outlinks contextualizing the event across languages over time?\nLeveraging the ILLs of outlinks, we see that not only are the outlinks available across languages is different but that the majority of outlinks that are included post-phenomenon are isolated within each linguistic version of this article.\nWhen do articles about related concepts link to the Arab Spring article, consolidating it within a broader context?\nAnalysis of Ego-networks shows that in English articles about countries that are involved with the Arab Spring include reference to the Arab Spring but they do not in Arabic. Both languages debate the reflective reference to the phenomenon page when broken down into individual events within the Arab Spring.\n###figure_1### ###figure_2###"

Within the context of Wikipedia, if a article has been neglected with little to no additions or changes, we assume the collective memory surrounding the topic to be settled and solidified within that linguistic community. To understand if the Arab Spring article is still salient, we looked at the size and number of outlinks within the article over time. Both of these attributes are simple measurements to identify continual efforts by editors to update and upkeep the article within contemporary contexts, possibly altering the way in which the Arab Spring is being remembered.

Both articles continue to change over time, point to an active editor group, constantly re-contextualizing the article. However, upon further analysis we realize that the size of the article is also heavily influenced by the editing of external references333External references refer to links to websites outside of Wikipedia, predominantly seen in sources.\nIn the English Arab Spring summary article the size has large variations at certain points in time. The large drop in 2012, was due to the transition of this article into a summary page as the outlinks were deleted from here and moved to the article about \u2018concurrent incidents\u2019. The next drop in 2016, as mentioned was due to an edit of references, but was influenced also by a restructuring of the \u2018Social Media and the Arab Spring\u2019 sub-section of the article. The size then started to rise a few months later from its local minimum, by editors adding to \u2019Aftermath\u2019 and \u2019Social Media\u2019 subsections of the article. Then in the beginning of 2017 a bot \u2018fixed 198 sources\u2019 largely increasing the size. The last large change in size was due to an individual editor, who in 2019 came in and restructured most of the page, adding or altering 5 sub sections of the article. These large changes in size through time points to continued salience within the editor community as they maintain external links as well as update subsections particularly about social media and what happened after the Arab Spring.\nWith only two main increases in size the Arabic Arab Spring summary article, a picture of an article that has very little negotiation or updating after 2013 is presented. In 2013, an editor deleted interwiki links444Interwiki links can be a link to another project, to another language and both, to another project in another language. away the article similar to external links having a relatively large change in size. In 2018, a bot repaired external references that linked to web pages that no longer existed. Although there isn\u2019t large variation in size like the English Arab Spring article, its consistent increase in size is due to editors continually making changes with edits even in 2023 such as,\n\u201d\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0642\u0635\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0632 \u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629\u201d\n(This sentence has a provocative meaning for some Syrian supporters of the Syrian government) resulting in a decrease of 19 bytes and \\RL\u201d\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631\u201d (Information without sources, removing tags) resulting in an increase of 63 bytes, constantly re-adjusting small things but that is related to the collective memory process."

This provides additional information and context that is not available just looking at size.\nIn the English version of the Arab Spring Summary article, outside of the largest drop of outlinks in 2012, due to the restructuring resulting in the English Arab Spring summary page, single editors coming in and making large updates to the article are what influence the number of outlinks changing. For example, in 2016 two editors came in and restructured the \u2019Social Media and the Arab Spring\u2019, \u2019International Pressures\u2019 and \u2019Aftermath\u2019 subsections of the article leading to the inverted plateau. The large increase in 2019 was the same single editor revision that caused an increase in size by altering 6 sub sections of the article that included, \u2019Results\u2019, \u2019Aftermath\u2019, \u2019Social Justice\u2019, and \u2019Counter-revolution and Civil Wars\u2019. In 2021, someone tried to redo the summary box and although it was immediately undone, and in 2022 an editor added 23 links to the Outcomes section but only caused the article to increase by 3 bytes in size and was shortly undone not long after\nIn the Arabic version of the article, the largest increase in number of outlinks was in February of 2012, someone did comprehensive overhaul of the introduction. There are two relatively small increases in October of 2015 where someone added more information about the events in Jordan and July of 2021 when a bot and a person both added information about Morocco. The last large increase was in March of 2023 where an individual editor make a large contribution over the whole month that he primarily tagged, \\RL \u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u0626\u064a  or \u2019Visual Editing\u2019.\nThe continual changes in size across languages and through time points to continued salience within both editor communities as they maintain external links and update subsections, particularly about social media and what happened after the Arab Spring in English. Although through smaller changes in Arabic, the continual engagement of editors through time confirms our question 1: the Arab Spring has continued to be a salient topic within both the English and Arabic Wikipedia communities."

Although this is an intuitive look at the the sense-making process, the production resulting from these discussions is what broader members of the linguistic community will interact with. That is why we operationalize deliberation through temporal outlink inclusion and exclusion. Outlinks are built into the Wikipedia infrastructure as a way to help readers learn more about a topic that an editor deems relevant to understanding the topic at hand. Their inclusion in the article can be the result of the previously studied editor dynamics but their inclusion and exclusion over time also lends insight into changing perspectives because information on Wikipedia articles are constantly being deliberated as new people get exposed to the content, as we saw through our analysis of article salience.\nTo analyze these outlinks through temporal inclusion we implement one hot encoding and vectorize outlink inclusion for each revision version of the Arab Spring article. We clustered these concepts by their pairwise similarity scores to create a heatmap that positions words with similar scores closer together creating a more digestible heatmap.

These are mostly all taken out in a large edit by an editor that pointed out that the Arabic version is the only version that includes the protests in Somolia as a part of the Arab Spring and then deletes the related section and content.\nOutlinks that are only at the end of this cluster are \\RL\u0623\u062d\u0632\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628 (Political Parties in Morocco), and \\RL\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628 (Moroccan Constitution). Similar to Clusters 1, 3, and 5, in the English version of this article, this subgroups this appears to be a deliberation over what broader regional events should be included in the Arab Spring summary page. However, because they are not included until recently and all remain included in the current version, these are labeled as \u2019Debated\u2019. They are added in this section by an editor with a small description in June of 2021. Without a description this editor re-writes the descriptions of the events in Morocco, excluding its ties to other protests and focusing more on internal events.\nUnderstanding outlinks to reflect distinct deliberation processes, we identify a \u2019Stable\u2019 inclusion of western concepts in the English version and contemporary conflicts in the Middle East in Arabic. \u2019Forgotten\u2019 and forgotten concepts related to simultaneous events in the Middle East, Asia, and Northern Africa in both languages, similar to the English version pointed to a definition of the Arab Spring is and the events that it encompasses. \u2019Debated\u2019 concepts within the editor and non-editor community in English that evolve as different editors get involved and contemporarily re-contextualize the phenomenon."

Most of the large changes in number of outlinks (figure 2), primarily stems from outlinks that cross languages but were only chosen to be included in the English version of this article. Since a majority of these edits revolved around the subsection of \u201dSocial Media\u201d and sections about after the phenomenon, the English Arab Spring page contextualizes what happened after, primarily through an isolated perspective, referencing articles that are available in both languages but only referenced in this language edition.\nIn figure 6(b) the Arabic Wikipedia page also reflects figure 2. The main change in outlinks from 2012 due to the change of the introduction, which makes sense because a majority of the shared articles are about foundational topics. However, the increase 2021 where a bot and a person made edits about Morocco appears to be isolated within concepts that are not referenced in the English article, providing an isolated linguistic perspective. Similarly the editor in March of 2023 who did alot of edits to various different parts did so by adding links that were already in the English page as well as add new links that would only be in the Arabic page. The number of shared outlinks between pages, is almost 50% of the outlinks in this article at a given time is in part due to the size, although it is so few articles since the Arabic article is significantly smaller, foundational outlinks take up more of the article proportionally. This produces a contextualization process that is not does not vary far off of the foundational concepts."

The consolidation of the Arab Spring as a fixture of this system would be its inclusion within the articles about the events and countries involved in the broader phenomenon. We identified eleven events888\u20192011 Omani protests\u2019, \u20192011\u20132012 Moroccan protests\u2019, \u20192011\u20132012 Jordanian protests\u2019, \u20192011 Iraqi protests\u2019, \u20192010\u20132012 Algerian protests\u2019, \u20192011 Bahraini uprising\u2019, \u2019Syrian revolution\u2019, \u2019Yemeni Revolution\u2019, \u2019Libyan civil war (2011)\u2019, \u20192011 Egyptian revolution\u2019, \u2019Tunisian Revolution\u2019 that both the English and Arabic versions of the summary article deemed \u2018important\u2019 and the countries in which those events take place999These events and countries were cross referenced between languages and the only discrepancy is that in the English article, the event associated with Syria was the \u201cSyrian Revolution\u201d article which is not referenced in the Arabic article at all. Instead in the Arabic article, \u201cThe Syrian Civil War\u201d page is referenced. Since that article is also referenced in the English article, that is the event we investigated..\nWe investigated this consolidation by generating country and event based ego networks101010A type of network from social network analysis that maps connections from a particular perspective\nfor monthly page revisions of the articles and their outlinks and measuring inclusion within those networks. The resulting figures do not present whether the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 article is mentioned but whether editors consider the \u2019Arab Spring; summary article a necessary and relevant point of information to contextualize the country or event.\n###figure_10### ###figure_11### Figure7(a) is a visual representation of the inclusion of the \u201cArab Spring\u201d as an outlink within the English language country articles. The English language country articles appear to only have slight deliberation about the inclusion of the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 in the articles. In 2014, all but one of the country\u2019s Wikipedia articles referenced the Arab Spring as an outlink in their article. This has a stark contrast to the English language event articles in Figure 7(b)that show debate about the inclusion of the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 summary page.\nThe \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 appears to consolidate the most within the Libyan, Bahraini, and Yemeni context with both the country and event having the most inclusion through time. These events have quite different resolutions with events in Bahrain ending in 2018 and events that were triggered by the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 creating diverting contemporary problems in Libya and Yemen.\nThe Iraqi, Egyptian, and Omani articles have the lowest inclusion in both their event and country articles. This points to a delayed connection between to \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 and could point to a distinction between the Arab Spring and those events. Alternatively it could be so tied to the concept of the Arab Spring, an additional reference wouldn\u2019t be necessary.\nThere is a discrepancy between the \u2019Syria\u2019 article including the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 consistently from the beginning and the Syrian event not beginning to include or negotiate its inclusion until after 2013. Within English Wikipedia, editors found the Arab Spring a defining characteristic of countries across the MENA111111Middle East and North Africa region and debate over phenomenon level referencing.\n###figure_12### ###figure_13### The Arabic language country and event articles debate the inclusion of the Arab Spring from the beginning, as shown in Figure 8.\nThe \u2019Libya\u2019 article and \u2019Iraq\u2019 article never include the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 and the \u2019Egypt; article only includes it for 2 or 3 months at a time; so rarely that it did not show on our visual. Arabic editors did not find linking the \u2019Arab Spring\u2019 to be a necessary contextualization of these countries. \u2019Jordan\u2019 and \u2019Bahrain\u2019, articles about two countries that had relatively smaller events, consolidate the Arab Spring as context in their Wikipedia articles through the most time. \u2019Morocco\u2019 and \u2019Oman\u2019 have larger debates and then only as of 2021 include the outlink.\nThe Syrian country article and event includes the Arab Spring through the longest amount of time but even this article in 2020 began debating its inclusion.\nOpposing the English language community on Wikipedia, the Arabic language community found it hardly necessary to link the Arab Spring article in adjacent articles.\nThere is a strong consolidation of the Arab Spring within the English country Wikipedia country articles but a majority of other articles analyzed across languages heavily debated the Arab Spring as necessary contextualization pointing to a varying consolidation within collective memory processes on Wikipedia and across languages."

Previous research has looked at collective memory processes or compared content across language editions, but this paper provides novel empirical findings about both of these components. We proposed an ensemble of quantitative constructs for measuring four distinct collective memory processes identified in memory studies: salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation. We evaluated these processes using a research design combining variation over time and across languages for articles related to the 2011 Arab Spring.\nSalience was operationalized as a measure of the size and number of outlinks. The English article surprisingly shows greater variation in size and content over time than the Arabic article, following patterns similar to punctuated equilibria: periods of stability interrupted by sudden changes. In contrast, the Arabic article is both shorter and more stable. Deliberation was operationalized as similarity in the temporal vectors of outlink occurrence. The English article had five distinctive clusters of behavior relating to outlink inclusion that we classified as \u201cstable\u201d, \u201cdebated\u201d, and \u201cforgotten\u201d interpretations while the Arabic article had only two clusters. Contextualization was operationalized as a measure of overlap in the inter-language link graph. Despite the availability of relevant topics across languages, the Arabic and English articles referenced very different concepts. Finally, consolidation was operationalized as references to the Arab Spring article in the articles about countries and their national-level protests. The Arabic Spring article is linked much less in Arabic articles for countries and events than in English.\nThese results highlighting disparities in the content and dynamics about the Arab Spring reinforce prior findings about the differences in coverage about the same topics across Wikipedia\u2019s language editions. The greater salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation on the English compared to the Arabic article for these major events is a surprising counterpoint to the \u201cself-focus bias\u201d found in other multilingual analyses (Hecht and Gergle 2009  ###reference_b13###, 2010  ###reference_b14###). The English article employs links reflecting Western cultural biases about history and politics that do not appear in the the Arabic version that provides its own distinctive contexts. Despite the greater geographic and cultural proximity of the events of the Arab Spring to Arabic speakers, the English-language article has far greater dynamism in its content and relationships than the Arabic-language article.

            "text": "The Arabic and English Wikipedias\u2019 coverage of the Arab Spring are structured by distinct collective memory practices. We developed an ensemble of generalizable quantitative methods grounded in definitions from memory studies to enable comparisons of collective memory processes across languages and over time. These methods could be extended to other cases to examine whether these processes on the English Wikipedia are reliably distinctive because of its size and influence or if other language editions with similar cultural proximity to these events (Farsi, Hebrew, Turkish, etc.) exhibit similarities to each other rather than to an outlier like English. Similarly, alternative constructs for collective memory processes and their empirical operationalizations might identify greater similarities or stronger differences.\nThese findings also contribute revisiting theories and methods for understanding collective memory processes. The concept of collective memory has been criticized from historiographical and cultural studies perspectives for reproducing dominant or revisionist historical narratives over alternative interpretations and marginalized perspectives (Confino 1997  ###reference_b3###; Kansteiner 2002  ###reference_b16###). Wikipedia\u2019s rules governing citations emphasize the use of reliable sources which may similarly privilege some framings and interpretations over others. Although major contemporary historical events like the Arab Spring should attract more representative cross-sections of editorial perspectives, Wikipedia is not immune from motivated editors \u201ccapturing\u201d pages to enforce specific narratives (Grabowski and Klein 2023  ###reference_b9###; Kharazian, Starbird, and Hill 2023  ###reference_b18###). Future work should examine whether the \u201cafterlives\u201d of articles documenting major historical events are prone to capture or unreliable narratives because of declining editorial attention.\nOur research design did not analyze the structure, dynamics, or content of discussions that accompanied the collaborations generating these articles. English and Arabic are each global languages with colonial legacies that do not map as cleanly to national boundaries as languages like Swedish, Hindi, or Japanese, for example. Collective memory cases drawn from those context may exhibit stronger self-focus biases than we saw with Arabic and English. Mechanisms like overlaps among contributors across articles and languages, conflicts over content, and processes for resolving disputes and forming consensus could have influenced the decisions to include or remove links over time we observed. A closer analysis of the content, discussions, and editors\u2019 activity could provide a richer description of additional forces shaping the content including and beyond outlinks on these articles.\nThe clustering of outlinks based on similarities in their temporal inclusion ignores other constructs for measuring the similarity of links and articles over time. Word embeddings trained on the content of out-linked articles, coauthorship patterns of contributing editors, or similarities in the pageview activity could all provide additional context and counterfactuals for the patterns of the observed temporal clustering. Understanding how outlink temporal inclusion vectors align with these other measures of similarity could have implications for large language and other natural language models trained on Wikipedia data. Because different language editions encode different content, content differences could be mistakenly equated and the resulting biases amplified. Characterizing the (mis)alignments across languages and over time is an important for identifying and preventing misalignments."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\n\nThe paper is motivated by the challenges involved in studying collective memory, particularly across linguistic and cultural contexts. Understanding collective memory is difficult due to the diverse evidence and sense-making processes involved. Wikipedia, as a \"global memory place,\" offers a unique test case to understand and compare the emergence and evolution of collective memory processes. The Arab Spring, a significant internet-mediated collective action spanning linguistic barriers, serves as a particularly salient case study for this investigation.\n\n### Research Problem\n\nThe primary research problem addressed in the paper is the lack of a thorough empirical examination of how collective memory processes evolve over time and across different linguistic editions on Wikipedia. Specifically, the paper seeks to understand the construction of collective memory around the events of the 2011 Arab Spring by comparing the structural and content changes in Arabic and English Wikipedia articles over a prolonged period. The study focuses on the use of \"outlinks\" (links from one article to another) and inter-lingual links (ILLs) to identify how consensus perspectives, conflicts, and other collective memory processes emerge and evolve.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n\nThe paper contributes to two main areas of empirical literature using Wikipedia data:\n\n1. **Studying Different Wikipedia Language Editions**:\n   - **Structure**: Prior work has examined the structural differences between Wikipedia language editions (Porter, Krafft, and Keegan 2020; Hickman et al. 2021; Adar, Skinner, and Weld 2009; He et al. 2018; Dandala, Mihalcea, and Bunescu 2012).\n   - **Content**: There has been research focused on comparing the content across different language editions (Hecht and Gergle 2010; Roy, Bhatia, and Jain 2022; Massa and Scrinzi 2012).\n   - **Collaboration Practices**: Studies have explored collaboration and deliberation practices within Wikipedia (Hale 2014).\n\n2. **Understanding Collective Memory Processes on Wikipedia**:\n   - This literature often focuses on how collective memory is formed through collaborations and content in the immediate aftermath of major events (Twyman, Keegan, and Shaw 2017; Luyt 2016; Ferron and Massa 2014).\n\nHowever, these areas have limitations that the paper seeks to address:\n   - Existing studies often focus on macroscopic patterns at a specific point in time, rather than the evolution of content over a long period.\n   - The focus is commonly on the days and weeks immediately following a major event, rather than on long-term collective memory processes.\n\n### Research Questions\n\nThe paper identifies four specific research questions to guide the analysis:\n1. **Salience**: Is the concept of the Arab Spring salient over the time period in question, indicating an ongoing process of collective memory?\n2. **Deliberation**: Do varying deliberation processes across languages result in divergent perspectives in the Wikipedia articles?\n3. **Contextualization**: How similar are the outlinks contextualizing the Arab Spring across languages over time?\n4. **Consolidation**: When do articles about related concepts link to the Arab Spring article, thereby consolidating it within a broader context?\n\nBy addressing these questions, the paper aims to develop a grounded understanding of four behaviors related to collective memory formation: salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation. This comprehensive analysis will enhance the understanding of collective memory processes, particularly in the context of significant historical events like the Arab Spring.",
        "methodology": "**Proposed Method or Model:**\n\nThe proposed method in this study aims to track the evolution and salience of collective memory surrounding the Arab Spring by analyzing Wikipedia articles in various languages. The key components and innovations of the method are as follows:\n\n1. **Temporal Complexity in Collective Memory:**\n   - The study emphasizes the importance of temporal complexity in understanding how collective memory evolves. Temporal complexity refers to the ongoing relevance and changes in the representation of an event or topic over time.\n\n2. **Salience Measurement:**\n   - To evaluate whether the Arab Spring remains a salient topic in different linguistic communities, the study examines the frequency and extent of changes to Wikipedia articles about the Arab Spring. Salience is determined by the size and number of outlinks (hyperlinks to other Wikipedia articles) in the Arab Spring article over time.\n\n3. **Use of Wikipedia Articles:**\n   - Wikipedia articles are used as a data source to gauge the collective memory in different languages. The assumption is that active and frequent edits, along with the addition of outlinks, indicate an ongoing engagement with and evolution of the topic, while minimal changes suggest the memory is more settled.\n\n4. **Measurement Indices:**\n   - Two primary indices are used to measure the activity and thus the salience of the topic:\n     - **Size of the Article:** The total length of the Wikipedia article, indicative of detailed and comprehensive coverage.\n     - **Number of Outlinks:** The hyperlinks within the article pointing to other Wikipedia pages, suggesting the connectedness and contextual expansion of the topic.\n\n5. **Privacy Considerations:**\n   - In conducting the analysis, the study ensures the privacy and safety of Wikipedia editors by not disclosing their names, focusing solely on the content changes.\n\nBy combining these components, the methodology intends to pinpoint how the collective memory of the Arab Spring diverges across different linguistic contexts and evolves over time based on the dynamic edit activity of Wikipedia entries.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup:\n\n#### Datasets:\n- **Wikipedia Articles on the Arab Spring:** Multiple language versions of Wikipedia articles related to the Arab Spring were analyzed over time.\n\n#### Baselines:\n- **Size and Number of Outlinks in Articles:** The experiment tracked changes in the size (measured in bytes) and the number of outlinks (hyperlinks to other articles) within the Arab Spring articles over time. These attributes serve as indicators of the article's salience and updates by editors.\n\n#### Evaluation Metrics:\n- **Temporal Changes in Article Attributes:** The primary metrics used for evaluation were:\n  - **Size of the Article:** Measured in bytes to reflect the amount of content.\n  - **Number of Outlinks:** The count of hyperlinks to other related articles within Wikipedia.\n\n### Main Experimental Results:\nThe main experimental findings indicated that:\n- Changes in both the size and the number of outlinks within the Arab Spring articles suggest ongoing efforts by Wikipedia editors to update and maintain these articles.\n- This continuous activity implies that the collective memory of the Arab Spring is still evolving and remains a salient topic within the linguistic communities represented by the various Wikipedia language editions.\n\nNote: Details about individual editors who made significant changes were not disclosed to ensure privacy and safety."
