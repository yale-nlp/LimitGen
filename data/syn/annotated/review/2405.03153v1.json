            "text": "News headlines are precursors to comprehensive stories and serve as persuasive messages, making their accuracy and authenticity crucial. Gabielkov et al. note that many readers may not proceed beyond the headlines to read the full content (Gabielkov et al., 2016  ###reference_b8###); however, they can still receive misleading information if these headlines do not accurately represent the content. We use the term Misleading News Headlines to describe this particular phenomenon. Misleading News Headlines arise when the headline of a news article fails to represent its content accurately. Consider the following example for illustration.\nHeadline:  Hot tea linked to increased risk of esophageal cancer 111https://tinyurl.com/misleading-headline-example1\nContent: People who like hot tea may want to wait until it gets cooler before taking that first sip. Drinking more than 700 milliliters of tea at higher than 60 degrees Celsius, or 140 degrees Fahrenheit, was linked to a 90 percent increased risk of esophageal cancer, according to a study \u2026\n\u201cMany people enjoy drinking tea, coffee, or other hot beverages. However, according to our report, drinking very hot tea can increase the risk of esophageal cancer,\u201d said lead author Farhad Islami, a researcher at the American Cancer Society and study lead author, in a news release. \u2026 In 2016, the International Agency for Research on Cancer said that drinking any drink over 65 degrees Celsius makes it a carcinogen or something likely to cause cancer.\nOther studies have linked drinking hot tea and drinking excessive amounts of alcohol daily to esophageal cancer, as well.\nThe headline Hot tea linked to increased risk of esophageal cancer is misleading because it specifically singles out hot tea, despite the article indicating that the risk is associated with consuming any very hot beverage. This narrow focus on hot tea could lead readers to incorrectly believe that only hot tea poses this cancer risk, potentially causing them to overlook the similar risks associated with other hot beverages. Consequently, readers might make uninformed decisions about their beverage choices, erroneously assuming that switching from hot tea to another hot drink, like coffee, would mitigate their risk of esophageal cancer when the temperature, not the type of beverage, is crucial.\nIf the headline is misleading, it may cause a wrong impression, leading to uninformed decision-making (Ecker et al., 2014  ###reference_b7###). Addressing the issue of Misleading News Headlines is critical to rebuilding trust in journalism and combating misinformation. Manual evaluations, while effective, are impractical due to the sheer volume and speed of news dissemination, necessitating automated solutions. However, constructing such systems presents challenges, particularly the need for extensive, high-quality data. Large-scale, representative datasets are essential for training robust machine learning models. This complexity underscores the significance of leveraging advanced techniques like Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and classify misleading headlines accurately, ultimately enhancing journalism\u2019s credibility and its ability to counteract misinformation.\nRecent advances in natural language processing have led to powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of understanding complex languages intricately  (Min et al., 2023  ###reference_b9###). These LLMs have been successfully applied to identify and rectify vaccine misinformation, showcasing their potential in public health communication and information validation  (Deiana et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###). However, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that misleading headlines differ from other forms of misinformation. Misleading headlines often straddle a fine line, potentially presenting skewed or exaggerated information without being entirely false. This distinct nature adds complexity to the task of utilizing LLMs to detect and address misleading headlines accurately. In light of this gray area, designing detection mechanisms can be more complex, resulting in the following research question: \nRQ: To what extent can Large Language Models accurately identify headlines as misleading?"

Our focus was on articles within the Health, Science & Tech, and Business domains. Three domain-knowledgeable annotators selected five articles from each domain from four sources, starting from March 31st, 2022, assessing if headlines were misleading by reviewing both the headline and the content. This process yielded a balanced preliminary dataset of 60 articles, comprising 30 misleading and 30 non-misleading headlines.\nDuring annotation, each annotator independently reviewed 40 articles (20 misleading and 20 non-misleading) compiled by the others, without source identifiers to avoid bias. The review process involved three rounds of detailed examination to label articles as misleading or non-misleading, with annotations reflecting varying confidence levels. Consensus was reached on 18 articles being unanimously misleading, while at least two annotators agreed on 27 articles. Given our rigorous criterion that a headline is considered misleading if it could potentially mislead at least one reader, the final dataset consisted of 37 misleading and 23 non-misleading headlines."

        "research_background": "### Motivation\nThe paper is motivated by the prevalent issue of misleading news headlines, which can significantly influence public opinion and decision-making. News headlines often serve as standalone pieces of information for many readers, as noted by Gabielkov et al. (2016), and misleading headlines can result in misconceptions and uninformed choices (Ecker et al., 2014). For instance, a headline like \"Hot tea linked to increased risk of esophageal cancer\" can mislead readers into thinking that only hot tea poses such a risk, while the actual risk lies in the consumption of very hot beverages, regardless of the type. Addressing misleading headlines is vital for maintaining trust in journalism and combating misinformation. \n\n### Research Problem\nThe central research problem the paper tackles is the automation of misleading news headline detection. Manual evaluation is impractical due to the vast amount of news generated daily, making automated solutions necessary. However, developing such systems is challenging due to the requirement for extensive and high-quality data. Moreover, misleading headlines often present skewed or exaggerated information rather than outright false statements, adding a layer of complexity to their identification.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Reader Engagement with Headlines**: Gabielkov et al. (2016) highlighted that many readers often do not go beyond the headlines, underscoring the importance of headline accuracy and its impact on public perception.\n   \n2. **Effects of Misleading Headlines**: Ecker et al. (2014) discussed the implications of misleading headlines, noting how they can lead to misinformation and uninformed decision-making, thus emphasizing the necessity of accurate news representation.\n   \n3. **Advances in Natural Language Processing**: Min et al. (2023) showcased the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding intricate language structures, which forms the basis of exploring their application in detecting misleading headlines.\n   \n4. **Application in Public Health**: Deiana et al. (2023) successfully applied LLMs to identify and correct vaccine misinformation, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in other domains of information validation.\n\nThe paper sets out to examine to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can be effectively used to identify misleading news headlines, navigating the complexities unique to this form of misinformation.",
        "methodology": "**Methodology: Exploring the Potential of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in Identifying Misleading News Headlines**\n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for identifying misleading news headlines. Our approach entailed a meticulous collection and annotation process, as well as a structured methodology to classify headlines as misleading or non-misleading.\n\n**Data Collection:**\nWe sourced news articles from 12 different outlets, which we categorized into two groups: reliable and unreliable. Reliable sources included prominent and widely recognized organizations such as ABC News, NY Times, and Washington Post. Unreliable sources included sites like Infowars and Lifezette, noted for their questionable credibility. The determinations were based on assessments from Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), a respected third-party website that evaluates the credibility of media sources.\n\n**Article Selection Process:**\nOur investigation focused on articles within three specific domains: Health, Science & Tech, and Business. Three annotators, each with domain-specific knowledge, were tasked with selecting articles. They picked five articles per domain from four different sources, specifically chosen from articles published starting March 31st, 2022. \n\n**Annotation Procedure:**\nEach annotator independently reviewed a subset of 40 articles (comprised of 20 misleading and 20 non-misleading headlines selected by the other annotators) to ensure there was no bias from knowing the source of the articles. \n\n**Data Balancing and Final Dataset Creation:**\nThroughout the annotation process, articles were assessed and labeled after thorough reviews of both the headlines and the content over three rounds. Articles were marked with various confidence levels concerning their misleading nature. Where consensus was necessary, 18 articles were deemed unanimously misleading. An agreement was reached on at least two annotators identifying 27 articles as misleading. Employing a rigorous criterion, an article's headline was considered misleading if it could potentially mislead at least one reader. Subsequently, the final dataset was balanced to include 37 misleading and 23 non-misleading headlines.\n\n**Key Innovations and Methodological Rigor:**\nThe key innovation lies in the multi-round, independent review process that minimizes bias and ensures diverse perspectives in the evaluation of each headline's potential to mislead. Moreover, the rigorous criterion for categorizing headlines as misleading enhances the reliability of our dataset.\n\nIn summary, our methodology incorporated careful selection of articles, a balanced review process, and judicious annotation criteria to establish a robust dataset, laying a strong foundation for testing the capacity of LLMs in distinguishing misleading news headlines.",

Gemini showed a similar trend but performed worse overall. ChatGPT-3.5 performed well in majority misleading (88.9%) and minority misleading (90%) cases. These results suggest that models align well with clear human consensus but struggle as consensus clarity decreases.",

            "experiment_process": "The experiment focused on analyzing model performance in mixed consensus scenarios, where human annotators had either a majority or minority agreement on whether headlines were misleading. This involved evaluating each LLM's ability to classify headlines correctly despite the subjective nature of the annotations.",
            "result_discussion": "The study found that LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4, struggled in mixed consensus contexts. ChatGPT-4's performance dropped significantly in majority misleading cases (33.33%) and was similarly low for minority misleading cases (20%). Gemini also showed poor performance under these conditions, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 managed better results (88.9% for majority misleading, 90% for minority misleading). These findings underscore the difficulty LLMs face in dealing with ambiguous human consensus, highlighting the need for models that are more sensitive to subjective and ethical aspects of misinformation detection.",
