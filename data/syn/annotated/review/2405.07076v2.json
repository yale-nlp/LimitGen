While RLHF has demonstrated success, it faces notable challenges. First, it is prone to biases inherent in human feedback, exacerbated by today\u2019s increasingly polarized society. Second, it is susceptible to reward hacking [9  ###reference_b9###, 53  ###reference_b53###, 55  ###reference_b55###], potentially leading LLMs to adopt unethical or harmful behaviors.\nA significant limitation of current research is its narrow focus on isolated behaviors, such as movie ratings or toxic language. This approach, akin to playing Whack-A-Mole\u2014suppressing undesirable outputs without addressing underlying behaviors\u2014and seldom leads to meaningful progress. For example, merely instructing someone to consistently make their bed does not necessarily change their underlying habits or attitudes. Additionally, fixing one issue may inadvertently aggravate others. Users have reported performance degradations in ChatGPT due to RLHF modifications that altered (forgot) the optimal parameters for other tasks [34  ###reference_b34###, 47  ###reference_b47###]. Similarly, psychological studies show that addressing an addiction problem often reveals underlying issues and triggers side effects [52  ###reference_b52###, 59  ###reference_b59###].\nWe introduce our framework, , which stands for Diagnostics, Interpretation, Knowledge-independent learning, and Ethical guardrails. Named after the Greek mythological figure representing justice, order, and judgment,  aims to enhance the ethical compliance of LLMs through transparent, interpretable, and independent oversight mechanisms.\nfunctions as an independent behavioral advisor, separate from the LLM\u2019s primary knowledge-processing capabilities. This architecture prevents ethical enhancements from affecting the LLM\u2019s ability to represent knowledge. As a consultative layer,  evaluates and influences the LLM\u2019s responses based on ethical standards without modifying the underlying neural structures/parameters. It maintains a clear division between behavior correction and knowledge acquisition, focusing exclusively on linguistic outputs. Using cognitive psychology principles,  provides ethical oversight effectively, adapting to emerging challenges and cultural shifts while ensuring the LLM remains accurate and ethically compliant.\nTo achieve its objectives, DIKE comprises four essential components:\nModeling Linguistic Behaviors:  starts by modeling and classifying linguistic behaviors, using a self-supervised learning approach to understand how specific linguistic features correlate with human emotions.\nModeling Context-Based Ethical Guardrails: Subsequently,  develops ethical guardrails by establishing guidelines that identify and prevent undesirable linguistic outputs, thereby ensuring the LLM operates within ethical boundaries.\nAdversarial Examinations and Conciliatory Explanations:  engages with an adversarial model\u2014essentially a duplicate of itself but conditioned to adopt an opposing stance stemming from different perspectives, such as cultural values. This interaction helps DIKE refine its decisions through rigorous testing and debates, adjusting its responses based on the adversarial input to reach a balanced conclusion.\nApplication Rectification of Outputs: If the output is found to be inappropriate or ethically misaligned,  intervenes to edit the content directly. This final step ensures that all communications not only comply with ethical standards but also preserve the intended emotional integrity, effectively acting as a safeguard against harmful expressions.\nTechnical Contributions of\nThe novel technical contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\nSeparating Behaviors from Knowledge:  distinctly separates behavioral guidance from the core knowledge functions of the LLM. This prevents interference, ensuring that ethical modifications do not compromise the accuracy of knowledge.\nQuantifying Behaviors and Emotions: We have developed quantitative models that map behaviors and basic emotions. These models use measures of emotion intensity and linguistic antonyms to provide a structured framework for interpreting and modifying LLM outputs.\nCounteracting Biases with Adversarial LLMs: By employing adversarial modules (, named after the mythological adversary of Dike, representing discord and competition), that reflect diverse cultural values and perspectives,  integrates both universal and cultural values into its core structure. This ensures adaptability and relevance across various contexts, echoing the dynamic tension between harmony and conflict seen in mythology."

This section presents representative works, their advancements, and limitations.\nHuman Feedback (RLHF):\nInitial advancements by Christiano et al. [10  ###reference_b10###] demonstrated how RLHF can steer language models towards desired outcomes based on human preferences. Newer techniques like Identity () Preference Optimization (PO) and Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) refine this approach by optimizing directly for user preferences, effectively addressing scalability challenges. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) further simplifies the feedback mechanism by using intuitive responses such as thumbs-up or thumbs-down, thereby enhancing training efficiency without the need for paired data [2  ###reference_b2###, 18  ###reference_b18###, 57  ###reference_b57###].\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently streamlined the process by focusing on the clear distinction between preferred and less preferred outputs, thus simplifying training and enhancing its stability [46  ###reference_b46###].\nAI-generated Feedback (RLAIF):\nTo mitigate reliance on extensive human-generated data, RLAIF utilizes feedback generated by AI. This method capitalizes on the generative capabilities of LLMs to produce training signals autonomously [3  ###reference_b3###, 37  ###reference_b37###].\nFurthermore, techniques such as Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Relative Preference Optimization (RPO) employ statistical methods and calibration techniques to enhance LLM responses. SLiC adjusts sequence generation probabilities to more accurately reflect real-world data distributions, while RPO improves response generation by comparing different response options across both identical and varied prompts. These adjustments significantly increase the training process\u2019s reliability and effectiveness [61  ###reference_b61###, 62  ###reference_b62###]."

This section outlines our approach, which begins with the modeling of basic emotions, augments them with linguistic antonyms, links these emotions to linguistic behaviors, and integrates ethical considerations.\nOur design philosophy is structured around three core principles. First, we distinctly separate behavior modeling from knowledge modeling. This separation is crucial to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting effect [34  ###reference_b34###, 47  ###reference_b47###], ensuring that enhancements in behavioral accuracy do not undermine the model\u2019s knowledge retention. Second, our focus is on AI ethics at the behavioral level, with a strong emphasis on interpretability. This approach enhances human-machine interaction, making it easier for administrators to evaluate and refine behavioral guardrails effectively, thus ensuring transparency. Third, we strive to maintain an unbiased model to ensure objective and fair ethical evaluations. To achieve this, we incorporate an adversarial module, , designed to challenge borderline ethical decisions. This ensures a broad consideration of diverse perspectives and cultural values, reflecting the dynamic tension between  and  inspired by their mythological counterparts. This adversarial interaction enriches our model\u2019s ability to navigate complex ethical landscapes and promotes a more balanced and inclusive decision-making process."

            "section_name": "Development of a Quantitative Emotional Model",
            "text": "Our discussion on the cognitive emotion model is grounded in the foundational works of Paul Ekman, Robert Plutchik, and Klaus Scherer [17  ###reference_b17###, 45  ###reference_b45###, 49  ###reference_b49###], who have significantly advanced our understanding by identifying \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cuniversal\u201d emotions. While their contributions are undeniably groundbreaking, their models present certain limitations. Notably, they lack a quantitative framework that allows for scaling between positive and negative emotions and for capturing the details of fine-grained, subtle emotional variations, which are often difficult to be represented by concise linguistic vocabularies.\nTo address these challenges, our  framework integrates linguistic semantics into the emotional modeling process. This integration preserves the foundational structure of \u201cbasic\u201d emotions and enhances their adaptability and granularity.\nFigure 5  ###reference_### in Appendix A illustrates Plutchik\u2019s Wheel of Emotions and Scherer\u2019s Geneva Emotion Wheel, which categorize primary emotions at varying intensities and pair them conceptually as opposites based on evolutionary roles, adaptive functions, and emotional experiences like control and valence, such as joy-sadness. However, certain pairings such as trust-disgust on Plutchik\u2019s wheel and most pairs on Scherer\u2019s do not align as direct antonyms, posing challenges for models that rely on straightforward negation and scalar representation of emotional intensity across diverse expressions.\nThe  framework introduces a linear scale that enables the intensification or inversion of emotions through negation factors. For example, joy is modeled as the negation of despair, and melancholy as despair multiplied by 0.3. This method allows for smooth transitions between emotional extremes and intermediate states. Additionally, the scaling system addresses challenges associated with intermediate word choices, which can be subjective and vary across cultures. For instance, determining the words that fall between \u2018respect\u2019 and \u2018trust\u2019, or between \u2018curiosity\u2019 and \u2018fascination\u2019, often requires careful cross-cultural consideration to ensure accuracy and relevance.\nCultural variations further complicate the direct translation of emotion words between languages, often failing to convey the original cognitive intensity. For example, the English word \u2018excitement\u2019 becomes \u2018excitation\u2019 in French, which might suggest agitation rather than enthusiasm. To address this,  employs scaling factors to recalibrate \u2018excitation\u2019 in French to reflect the positive intensity of \u2018excitement\u2019 in English, aligning it more closely with \u2018enthousiasme,\u2019 which carries a universally positive connotation.  ensures that anchor emotions are effectively translatable across linguistic and cultural boundaries, with scalar operations simplifying the interpretation of subtleties in between.\nTable 1  ###reference_### summarizes \u2019s emotion model, divided into seven spectra, each\nconsists of a negative and a positive extreme with neutral in the middle.\nEmotions belonging to the same spectrum\nof various intensities are placed in between the negative and positive poles, with four emotion intensities\napproximately quantified as (-0.6, -0.3, +0.3, +0.6)."

The sentiments expressed in the linguistic behaviors (on the second column) were found to be highly correlated with those of the corresponding emotions (on the third column). Figure 1(b)  ###reference_sf2### shows a strong diagonal relation of this simple (almost\nnaive) zero-shot mapping between behaviors and emotions.\nNext, we employed the  self-supervised learning pipeline to analyze the emotion spectrum associated with each linguistic behavior, as presented in the table. We tasked GPT-4 with generating training data by rewriting 54 extensive letters from the Kaggle Love Letters dataset, which we augmented with twelve celebrated love poems. We reserved 24 letters as testing data. This approach, proposed by [51  ###reference_b51###], was designed to generate a rich diversity in content and stylistic context, spanning two hundred years and incorporating the voices of over 50 distinct authors for significant rewrites. The datasets and code are publicly available at [1  ###reference_b1###].\n###figure_1### ###figure_2### Subsequently, emotions linked to each behavior were identified. Figure 1(a)  ###reference_sf1### illustrates these emotions, with cell shading reflecting the frequency of specific emotions across the 54 articles; darker shades indicate higher frequencies. Notably, opposite emotions like sadness, fear, joy, and love often co-occur within behaviors such as \u2018despair\u2019, \u2018wishful\u2019, and \u2018joyful affection\u2019.\nThe distribution of emotions across linguistic behaviors has unveiled surprising patterns, challenging our initial hypotheses. Contrary to expectations, articles with a despair tone often also displayed positive emotions like love, joy, and happiness. This contradicts the simple mapping made by GPT-4, as illustrated in Figure 1(b)  ###reference_sf2###. GPT-4, influenced by its training corpora, typically associates positive behaviors with positive emotions and negatives with negatives.\nAnalysis of selected articles, such as Zelda Sayre to F. Scott Fitzgerald (Appendix C), shows a complex spectrum of emotions:\nLove (+1.0): Expressed intensely, especially in phrases like \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in all the world I want but you.\u201d\nDespair (-1.0): Notable in comments like \u201cI\u2019d have no purpose in life, just a pretty decoration.\u201d\nHappiness (+0.6): Evident in future plans, \u201cWe\u2019ll be married soon, and then these lonesome nights will be over forever.\u201d\nAnxiety (-0.3): Shown by \u201csometimes when I miss you most, it\u2019s hardest to write.\u201d\nPsychological Insights: Our findings echo theories of multiple \u201cselves\u201d coexisting within individuals, supported by Deisseroth\u2019s optogenetic studies [14  ###reference_b14###] and discussed in William James\u2019 \u201cThe Principles of Psychology\u201d [31  ###reference_b31###]. Minsky\u2019s \u201cSociety of Mind\u201d [41  ###reference_b41###] also aligns with this, suggesting the human mind operates through interactions among simple agents.

The specific changes are indicated with emotion-laden words highlighted in blue within Table 10  ###reference_0###. This allows for a direct comparison between the two versions at opposite ends of the linguistic behavior spectrum, illustrating the alterations in words related to brightness, attire, and emotions. The edits extend beyond merely replacing adjectives mechanically; they include modifying verbs and enhancing descriptive imagery to evoke a stronger emotional resonance and vividness in the text.\n###table_3###"

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation\nThe paper is motivated by the shortcomings of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in addressing ethical concerns within Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors argue that RLHF is prone to biases due to polarized societal feedback and is vulnerable to reward hacking, where models may adopt unethical or harmful behaviors. Additionally, existing research approaches tend to focus on isolated behaviors rather than underlying habits, often leading to temporary and inconsistent solutions without holistic improvement. There is also a critical issue of performance degradation in LLMs when RLHF modifications inadvertently alter optimal parameters for other tasks. \n\n### Research Problem\nThe primary research problem addressed in this paper is the need for a robust, transparent, and independent framework to enhance the ethical compliance of LLMs without compromising their knowledge representation and processing capabilities. The authors aim to develop a system that mitigates biases, adapts to emerging challenges, and ensures ethical adherence in LLM outputs while maintaining the core functionalities of the model. \n\n### Relevant Prior Work\nThe paper builds upon and critiques several prior studies and methodologies:\n\n- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Highlighted for its success but criticized for its susceptibility to inherent biases and reward hacking. Prior works such as [42, 43] demonstrate RLHF's application but also point out its limitations.\n- **Behavioral Focus:** Existing research often tackles isolated behaviors (e.g., movie ratings, toxic language) rather than addressing foundational issues, compared to overly simplistic approaches like \"playing Whack-A-Mole\" [9, 34, 47, 53, 55]. \n- **Psychological Studies:** Cited to draw parallels between RLHF's shortcomings and psychological phenomena where addressing one issue (e.g., addiction) may reveal underlying problems and potentially introduce side effects [52, 59].\n\nThese prior works contribute to the understanding of the problem landscape and the necessity for a more comprehensive, integrated approach to ethical compliance in LLMs.",
        "methodology": "Integrating Emotional and Linguistic Models for Ethical Compliance in Large Language Models\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe development of a quantitative model for analyzing emotions, behavior, and ethics is guided by four essential criteria: characterization, measurability, predictability, and interpretability. This section details our approach, which is initiated by modeling basic emotions and is then expanded through the incorporation of linguistic antonyms. These emotions are subsequently linked to linguistic behaviors and reinforced with ethical considerations.\n\nOur design philosophy revolves around three core principles:\n\n1. **Separation of Behavior Modeling from Knowledge Modeling:** \n   This principle ensures that improvements in behavioral accuracy do not jeopardize the model\u2019s retention of knowledge, thereby addressing the catastrophic forgetting effect [34 ###reference_b34###, 47 ###reference_b47###]. This separation is vital for maintaining the robustness and reliability of the model.\n\n2. **Ethics Focused on Interpretability at the Behavioral Level:**\n   By concentrating on AI ethics at the behavioral level, with a strong emphasis on interpretability, we enhance human-machine interaction. This clarity allows administrators to effectively evaluate and refine behavioral guardrails, ensuring transparency and facilitating the oversight process.\n\n3. **Maintenance of an Unbiased Model:**\n   To guarantee impartial and fair ethical evaluations, we incorporate an adversarial module designed to test borderline ethical decisions. This module ensures the model considers a broad spectrum of perspectives and cultural values, inspired by the mythological counterparts representing dynamic tension. This adversarial interplay enriches the model\u2019s capability to navigate complex ethical challenges, thus promoting balanced and inclusive decision-making.\n\nIn summary, by integrating basic emotions with linguistic antonyms, linking them to behaviors, and embedding ethical considerations, our methodology focuses on maintaining a clear delineation between behavioral and knowledge modeling, ensuring interpretability and transparency in ethical compliance, and incorporating a robust mechanism to challenge and balance the ethical decision-making process.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "In this paper, the main experiment setup and results revolve around evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating emotional and linguistic models to regulate the ethical behaviors of large language models (LLMs). The experiments aim to address three critical questions: the effectiveness of emotion modeling, the independent evaluation of linguistic behaviors, and the efficacy of a checks-and-balances system in mitigating excessive censorship.\n\n### Datasets:\nThe primary dataset used for these evaluations is a collection of love letters sourced from Kaggle. The originally planned use of Kaggle hate-speech datasets was abandoned due to the refusal of both Gemini and GPT-4 to process hate speech data. However, the insights from analyzing love sentiment are deemed applicable for understanding and analyzing opposite sentiments.\n\n### Baselines:\n1. Behavior Classification: The performance of LLMs' linguistic behavior evaluation and adjustment is analyzed with the aid of an external module.\n2. Behavior Correction: The potential of an adversarial LLM to create a checks-and-balances system is evaluated to examine its capability to prevent excessive censorship.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics:\nThe experiment employs various qualitative and quantitative metrics, assessing:\n1. The capacity for independent evaluation, explanation, and adjustment of linguistic behaviors by an external module.\n2. The effectiveness of a checks-and-balances system implemented by an adversarial LLM in mitigating excessive censorship.\n\n### Main Experimental Results:\n- **Behavior Classification (Section 4.2)**: The study reveals that LLMs\u2019 linguistic behaviors can be independently evaluated, explained, and adjusted by an external module effectively. This finding supports the viability of having an external evaluative module for ensuring ethical compliance in LLMs.\n\n- **Behavior Correction (Appendix S)**: The checks-and-balances system designed with an adversarial LLM notably mitigates the risk of excessive censorship. This system adds a layer of accountability, ensuring that the ethical guardrails do not overly restrict linguistic expressions.\n\nOverall, while the study acknowledges the broad scope of AI ethics and the limited data, the findings provide positive insights into the potential of integrating emotional and linguistic models for enhancing the ethical compliance of large language models."
