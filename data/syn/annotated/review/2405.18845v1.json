    "abstract": "Data crowdsourcing is a data acquisition process where groups of voluntary contributors feed platforms with highly relevant data ranging from news, comments, and media to knowledge and classifications. It typically processes user-generated data streams to provide and refine popular services such as wikis, collaborative maps, e-commerce sites, and social networks. Nevertheless, this modus operandi raises severe concerns regarding ill-intentioned data manipulation in adversarial environments.\nThis paper presents a simulation, modelling, and classification approach to automatically identify human and non-human (bots) as well as benign and malign contributors by using data fabrication to balance classes within experimental data sets, data stream modelling to build and update contributor profiles and, finally, autonomic data stream classification. By employing WikiVoyage\u2013a free worldwide wiki travel guide open to contribution from the general public\u2013as a testbed, our approach proves to significantly boost the confidence and quality of the classifier by using a class-balanced data stream, comprising both real and synthetic data. Our empirical results show that the proposed method distinguishes between benign and malign bots as well as human contributors with a classification accuracy of up to .",

            "text": "Crowdsourcing platforms primarily rely on data produced and shared by an extensive network of contributors, known as \u201cThe Crowd\u201d. Given the ubiquitous Internet access and the increasing user-generated data sources, the number of crowdsourcing systems has dramatically increased in recent times, significantly modifying the online behaviour of users and businesses. People no longer rely on expert advice but on the experiences of other users to make decisions on purchases, leisure, news, learning, and information in general.\nSuch platforms integrate Artificial Intelligence (ai) techniques such as data mining to swiftly process the crowd feedback and provide tailored up-to-date services on the fly using data streams. However, the processing opacity and the voluntary nature of crowdsourced data raise algorithmic transparency and data reliability concerns. On the one hand, the opacity of ai algorithms affects the interpretability of the results and can only be tackled by developers at the algorithmic design stage. On the other hand, data manipulation performed on behalf of third-party interests has become omnipresent in crowdsourcing platforms with fake news in social networks, biased feedback in evaluation-based platforms, and undesired (spam) content in wiki pages. Such underground activities, which negatively impact the reliability of the results, are typically performed at large scale by ill-intentioned bots in adversarial contexts.\nCommonly construed as self-activated software agents programmed to run continuously in distributed network environments, bots perform tasks and make decisions on behalf of their creators without direct human intervention. They typically sense, perceive, and adapt to the context they operate. According to Tsvetkova et al. (2017) [1  ###reference_b1###], all four main types of bots\u2013content extractors, action executors, content generators, and human emulators\u2013include benign and malign sorts. While benign bots tend to perform repetitive tasks to improve quality of service and system conditions, malign bots are designed to degrade content and system conditions by conveying false or biased information, altering system parameters, and/or tampering with data sources.\nThis work addresses the real-time profiling and classification of Wikivoyage contributors into human and non-human (bots) as well as benign and malign contributors. The proposed method relies on data simulation and modelling of wiki streams to obtain an automatic classification of contributors. While the data fabrication balances classes to improve the consistency of the results, data stream modelling builds contributor profiles on the fly.\nTherefore, this paper furnishes a data stream classification to identify deceitful sources in real-time. Specifically, contributors are modelled using review-based information (e.g., number of reviews, frequency of reverts, links, and number of characters inserted and deleted) and ORES edit quality111Available at www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES  ###reference_awiki.org/wiki/ORES###, December 2021., an Application Programming Interface (api) designed for wiki platforms, which helps to automate vandalism detection and removal. The model is incrementally updated with each incoming review. The classifier uses the contributor profile, first, to differentiate humans from bot users. Then, we employ a stack-based Machine Learning (ml) model, i.e., a two-level stacking system, to detect both bot/human users and positive/negative contributions.\nThe experiments have been conducted using a real Wikivoyage data set containing  bots and  humans. Despite the imbalanced class distribution, the final two-level stacking classifier presents results between  and  concerning the accuracy and F-measure (both macro and micro results per class).\nTo balance classes within the experimental data set, this work adopts a data fabrication scenario based on synthetic-generated data. The real and synthetic data have been combined, improving the system performance and proving the solution efficiency. In summary, our proposal allows us to understand the behaviour of both benevolent and malevolent bots to pre-empt malign contributions and, ultimately, to prevent attacks to wiki pages.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows.\nSection 2  ###reference_### includes relevant related work concerning contributor modelling and classification. Section 3  ###reference_### introduces the proposed approach, describing the profiling, classification, and data fabrication model.\nSection 4  ###reference_### presents the empirical evaluation results of the developed classifiers, including the simulation of synthetic data to balance the classes within the experimental data set.\nFinally, Section 5  ###reference_### concludes and highlights new perspectives to detect ill-intentioned contributors."

This common practice found in the literature [26  ###reference_b26###, 27  ###reference_b27###, 28  ###reference_b28###, 29  ###reference_b29###] supports the generation of relevant scenarios that, in most cases, are absent in the real data. Furthermore, it produces anonymous data, thereby maintaining the privacy of information. This process balances experimental data sets with synthetic samples which, in turn, are used to build models that react and operate correctly under the considered scenario.\nIn classification, it is desirable to have data equally distributed among classes, i.e., ensure the data is free of any class bias. The main benefit of this scenario, where classifier models are built with balanced experimental data, is that they display higher classification accuracy.\nIn this work, synthetic data generation constitutes a user-controlled, accurate, cost-effective, efficient and scalable way to balance the classes within the experimental data set.\nSynthetic samples were created using a statistical approach based on the quartile distribution of the most relevant features for both targets. In particular, the proposed synthetic data generation method creates feasible editor daily incremental activity samples corresponding to the two target categories.

Note that online models are built from scratch and incrementally updated and evaluated, whereas the offline models are trained and then tested using distinct data partitions. Zheng et al. (2019) [22  ###reference_b22###] detect the type of contributor and contributions with a similar performance in both accuracy and macro F-measure to the proposed method. However, social media data should be treated as streams since new revisions arrive continuously, resulting in instant classifier updates [16  ###reference_b16###, 17  ###reference_b17###]. Thus, having comparable results endorses the proposed method.\nTaking into account solely contribution type detection, Adler et al. (2011) [5  ###reference_b5###] report  accuracy with a rather low recall metric of , whereas Choi et al. (2016) [8  ###reference_b8###] match the same accuracy value without additional metrics for fair comparison. Kumar et al. (2016) [14  ###reference_b14###] identify hoaxers from non-hoaxers with  accuracy ( and  percent points lower in accuracy for contribution type detection than our proposal as shown in Table 6  ###reference_### and Table 7  ###reference_###, respectively). Compared to Green & Spezzano (2017) [15  ###reference_b15###] and Velayutham et al. (2017) [11  ###reference_b11###] contributor type detectors, our solution attains  and  percent points in accuracy for bot detection (see Table 5  ###reference_### and Table 7  ###reference_###, respectively). Finally, Zheng, Albano et al. (2019) [19  ###reference_b19###] also report worse results for contributor classification: almost  and  percent points regarding macro F-measure for bot detection according to Table 5  ###reference_### and Table 7  ###reference_###, respectively. Since the obtained online results contemplate all data samples rather than just the test partition samples, the proposed stream-based method considerably improves the task of classifying contribution and contributor types. Note that some works were not included in this analysis, e.g., [1  ###reference_b1###, 6  ###reference_b6###, 7  ###reference_b7###, 13  ###reference_b13###, 16  ###reference_b16###, 17  ###reference_b17###, 20  ###reference_b20###], since they do not provide directly comparable metrics."

            "text": "Wiki-based repositories are built by a network of contributors, known as the crowd. The crowd voluntarily shares information related to people, places, entities, etc. This voluntary nature of crowdsourcing platforms facilitates unethical behaviours from ill-intentioned human and bot contributors, enabling fraudulent data manipulation to satisfy third party interests. This scenario raises reliability concerns regarding the data quality of wiki-based platforms. To mitigate these issues, this work proposes a stream-based method to automatically classify contributors and their contributions. Specifically, the overall solution is composed of two distinct components: (i) offline data pre-processing and data simulation; and (ii) stream-based contributor profiling and classification. Pre-processing encompasses data analysis, feature engineering, and feature selection to identify the most promising edition-related features for profiling. The simulation is based on synthetic data generation to solve the deep class imbalance of the original data set. The stream-based profiling incrementally builds the profiles of contributors based on the selected edit features. The classification explores different stream-based binary classifiers with both class-imbalanced and class-balanced data streams to finally choose a stacking multi-class classifier that simultaneously identifies benign and malign humans and bots.\nThe proposed method was tested and evaluated with a real data set from Wikivoyage holding contributions from  bots and  humans, using classification accuracy and F-measure metrics. The experiments were conducted using the original Wikivoyage data together with synthetic data as streams, which incrementally update contributor profiles and classifier models. The final two-level stacking classifier presents results that vary between  and  concerning accuracy and F-measure, proving the efficiency of the method.\nTo sum up, this paper describes a solution that can be used to anticipate and isolate malevolent content produced by the identified malign contributors. As future work, the plan is to generate stream-based synthetic data as well as explain classifications, employing Natural Language Processing techniques to generate statements automatically."

        "research_background": "### Motivation:\nThe primary motivation of this paper stems from the ubiquitous reliance on crowdsourced data facilitated by platforms like wikis, which has fundamentally modified online user behavior and decision-making. Despite the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to process user-generated content swiftly, there are significant concerns about algorithmic transparency and data reliability. These concerns arise because of the opacity in AI algorithms and the manipulation of data for third-party interests, manifesting as fake news, biased feedback, and spam content. The impact of such malicious activities, often conducted by bots, on the reliability of crowdsourced platforms necessitates an effective method for real-time profiling and classification of contributors.\n\n### Research Problem:\nThe paper addresses the problem of differentiating between human and bot contributors, as well as between benign and malign contributions on Wikivoyage. This is achieved through the development of a method that relies on data simulation and modelling of wiki streams to enable automatic classification of contributors. The ultimate goal is to furnish a data stream classification that identifies deceitful sources in real-time and thereby precludes attacks on wiki pages.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n1. **Tsvetkova et al. (2017)**: The authors review the nature and types of bots in crowdsourcing systems, categorizing them into content extractors, action executors, content generators, and human emulators, with a distinction between benign and malign behaviours. This classification provides foundational understanding for differentiating among various types of bots that might contribute to Wikivoyage.\n\n2. **ORES API**: The use of ORES (Objective Revision Evaluation Service) edit quality API is cited as a tool for automating vandalism detection and removal in wiki platforms, which informs the profiling of contributors based on the quality of their edits. The inclusion of ORES in the methodology emphasizes the importance of leveraging existing AI tools tailored for wiki services.\n\n### Summary:\nWith the backdrop of these motivations and prior work, the paper embarks on developing a two-level stack-based Machine Learning model to classify Wikivoyage contributors, thereby tackling issues of trust and data integrity on crowdsourcing platforms. The model incrementally updates as reviews come in, balancing real and synthetic data to improve the accuracy and consistency of the classification results.",
        "methodology": "The proposed method to simulate, model, and classify Wiki contributors involves a structured multi-stage process consisting of four primary stages:\n\n(i) **Pre-processing**: This stage begins with the analysis of input data by assessing pairwise correlations (detailed in Section 3.1.1) to identify relationships between different variables. Following this, feature engineering (Section 3.1.2) is employed to select the most relevant features for creating accurate contributor profiles (Section 3.1.3).\n\n(ii) **Synthetic Data Generation**: In Section 3.2, the method generates synthetic data to balance the various classes of contributors and improve the overall effectiveness of the classification models. This synthetic data complements the real data, thus providing a more robust dataset for subsequent analysis.\n\n(iii) **Classification**: The combined dataset (real and synthetic) undergoes incremental processing to model and classify contributors. This is covered in Section 3.3 (modeling) and Section 3.4 (classification). The classification stage leverages well-known algorithms and explores both single-class (binary) and a novel multi-class classification approach using stacking techniques to categorize contributors and their activities.\n\n(iv) **Evaluation**: Finally, the outcomes of the classification are evaluated using standard classification metrics, as discussed in Section 3.5. This ensures that the model's performance can be accurately assessed and validated.\n\nThe proposed method thus integrates a sophisticated process of data pre-processing, synthetic data generation, modeling, classification, and thorough evaluation to effectively profile Wiki contributors and classify their contributions as good, bad, or ugly.",
