There has been considerable recent interest in studying the neural representations that support this process (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?).\nHere we use computational modeling to better understand the representations that support listeners\u2019 temporal processing of speech.\nOur focus is on a recent study by ? (?) that investigated this question by analyzing MEG recordings from human listeners.\nGwilliams et al. replicated previous findings that the brain processes multiple phones simultaneously, showing that brains simultaneously encode at least three consecutive phones.\nThey further showed that the encoding patterns of each phone are not static, but rather evolve over time.\nAdditionally, they explored the extent to which each phone is encoded independently to its neighboring phones, and concluded that at least some part of the phone encoding is context-invariant.\nThese characteristics of neural speech processing are likely to play a role in supporting human listeners\u2019 ability to integrate information across time, but it is not known how or why these characteristics arise.\nOur simulations build on Gwilliams et al.\u2019s findings by performing similar analyses on representations extracted from a self-supervised computational model that is trained to predict the upcoming acoustics based on context.\nWe find that, like humans, the model processes multiple phones simultaneously and its representations of those phones evolve over time.\nMoreover, like humans, both our model and an acoustic baseline show at least some context invariance.\nThis suggests that many of the properties of speech representations that Gwilliams et al. found can arise through predictive learning, without requiring prior linguistic knowledge.\nWe further identify properties in our models\u2019 representations that appear to deviate from those found in humans, and thus may not be direct representational consequences of the prediction task.\nAs a whole, our work illustrates how modern architectures from speech technology can help provide insight into the factors that shape speech representations in human listeners."

In future work we plan to replicate our experiment on hand-aligned data and consider durations of phones in our analysis.\n###figure_1### Two other points are worth noting regarding these results.\nFirst, phones can be decoded with a much higher accuracy from CPC representations than from acoustic features, which implies that different phones become more linearly separable in the learned representations.\nSecond, CPC representations seem to support predictive decoding, since phones are decodable 70ms prior to logmel features.\nWhile this is not surprising given that the model is trained to predict the upcoming speech, it does differ from the findings of neuroimaging studies\u2014a point we return to in the General Discussion."

However, as noted above, to better interpret this level of generalization, we also need to consider the extent to which acoustic similarity alone might explain patterns of generalization in the model representations. First, we note that for the decoder trained on acoustic features from p1, there is also some (albeit minimal) degree of generalization to p2\u2013p4, as shown in Figure 3(b)  ###reference_.sf2### (right). In addition, Figure 4(a)  ###reference_.sf1### illustrates how the degree of generalization depends on both the training and testing sets: for example, decoders trained on p4 and tested on the other three positions generalize somewhat better than those trained at p1.\nTurning to generalization across phonetic contexts,\nwe can again see from Figure 4(b)  ###reference_.sf2### (left) that the decoders trained on fricative__fricative generalized to different degrees when tested on other context types.\nSpecifically, the improvement over baseline in the test context of plosive__nasal was relatively modest.\nMeanwhile, Figure 4(b)  ###reference_.sf2### (right) shows that the decoders trained for logmel features also struggled to generalize to the same test context.\nA possible explanation is that the acoustics of vowels in this context differed more significantly due to nasalization.\nThis hypothesis is consistent with the fact that the generalization for logmel features in the test context fricative__nasal was initially strong around phone onset before the performance dropped below baseline, since this test context shared the same preceding phone as the training context but had a nasal as the following phone.\nThis pattern of dropping below and then returning to the baseline was not observed in the results for CPC representations.\nNevertheless, the results considered so far suggest that the generalization effects in CPC representations may be dependent on acoustic similarities in general.\n###figure_5### ###figure_6### To evaluate this hypothesis more systematically, we quantified the degree of generalization in CPC or logmel for each (training, test) context pair, as illustrated in Figure 5  ###reference_###(left).\nThe relationship between generalization effects in CPC and in logmel was then visualized in Figure 5  ###reference_###(right), where each data point corresponds to a particular (training, test) context pair, with the (x,y) coordinates indicating that pair\u2019s generalization effect in CPC and logmel respectively. We only include pairs where the training and test sets are different contexts.\nThe 12 blue dots in Figure 5  ###reference_### show the generalization effects across phone positions, which has a Pearson correlation of 0.97 ().\nThe 30 orange data points represent generalization effects across phonetic contexts, with Pearson correlation of 0.60 ().\nBoth correlations are strong enough to suggest that both cross-position and cross-context generalization in CPC representations depend on similarities between the acoustics of the training and the test contexts.\nWhile it is still possible that the learning induces some additional context invariance beyond acoustic similarity, the partial generalization found here does not seem sufficient to conclude that.\n###figure_7###"

A notable exception is that word-initial phones, but not those in other positions, appear to be decodable at phone onset in Gwilliams et al.\u2019s study.\nGiven the predictive nature of our model, it is not surprising to find predictive representations, but our finding does highlight the surprising lack of such findings in brain imaging studies. It is well-established behaviorally that human listeners make predictions about upcoming linguistic material (?, ?). Recent studies have also argued that fMRI and ECoG data from listening to speech and reading text are well-modelled by predictive models of text (?, ?, ?, ?), and have found evidence that specific words are decodable from ECoG recordings prior to word onset, indicating word-level predictive representations (?, ?). An important question for future work is therefore whether current tools are simply not sensitive enough to identify lower-level predictive representations in the brain, or whether these are indeed absent\u2014implying that prediction operates only over higher-level representations.\nThis research provides insight into the factors that shape speech representations in humans and machines, but leaves a number of open questions. For example, the recurrent neural network architecture used here differs from the transformer architecture that is now more often used in speech technology, and future research can explore whether attention-based architectures, such as transformers, also yield speech representations that exhibit similar characteristics. The field\u2019s interest in characterizing human speech representations also stems, in large part, from a desire to understand how the structure of these representations support higher-level tasks, such as word recognition. Here, computational models can be particularly useful in enabling a controlled comparison between different representations, especially because representations from these models have enabled large advances in the accuracy with which speech technology performs those higher-level tasks.\nFinally, although this work is primarily aimed at cognitive scientists, it may also be relevant for speech technology researchers, since the model we use shares many characteristics with current state-of-the-art SSL models for speech.\nWithin the speech technology community, analyses of\nDNN models\u2019 phonetic representations have mainly focused on how accessible phonetic or phonemic information about the current phone is, either in different models (?, ?) or across model layers (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?).\nThere is less work on how such information is encoded, although a few researchers have used clustering or visualization to investigate this question (?, ?, ?, ?, ?), while others have shown that formants are represented in a structured way (?, ?) and that phonetic and speaker information are represented in orthogonal subspaces (?, ?).\nWe know of no analyses examining the temporal dynamics of speech representations, or of any that investigate context-invariance by testing decoders for generalization to unseen contexts. These questions and methods, inspired by work in cognitive neuroscience and demonstrated on SSL models by this study, could prove fruitful for other researchers interested in analyzing speech model representations for their own sake."

This process involves overcoming challenges such as co-articulation and ambiguity in speech sounds, which blend into each other and can form multiple words. The study aims to address the intricacies of the neural representations that enable this perceptual feat and to understand how these representations support the temporal processing of speech.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe primary research problem the paper addresses is understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the temporal dynamics and context effects in speech perception. Specifically, the study seeks to investigate how human brains encode successive phones and how these encoding patterns evolve over time. Additionally, it aims to determine the extent to which each phone is encoded independently of its neighbors and to identify the factors contributing to context-invariance in speech representation. The paper attempts to shed light on whether these neural characteristics can be modeled using computational approaches, particularly self-supervised learning models that predict upcoming acoustics.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n- The paper builds on recent studies focused on neural representations supporting speech perception, notably a study by Gwilliams et al., which analyzed MEG recordings to explore these neural dynamics. \n- Gwilliams et al. found that the brain processes multiple phones simultaneously, with encoding patterns evolving over time and showing some context-invariance.\n- The current paper aims to extend this work by using computational models to simulate and analyze these neural representations. The goal is to determine if a self-supervised model trained to predict acoustics based on context can replicate human-like processing of speech sounds.\n- Previous research has established that human speech processing involves complex, temporally dynamic interactions between sequential phones. This study seeks to replicate and expand these findings using predictive learning models from speech technology.",

The results are meticulously grouped by each simulation, highlighting the model's performance in:\n\n1. **Determining the window for phonetic decodability:**\n   - This involves identifying the temporal frame within which phonetic information can be accurately decoded.\n\n2. **Analyzing the time course of phone encoding:**\n   - This simulation examines how phonetic information is represented over time within the continuous speech stream.\n\n3. **Evaluating cross-context generalization:**\n   - This test assesses the capability of phonetic decoders to generalize across different contexts, indicating robustness and versatility of the model in variable speech scenarios.\n\nThe methodology aims to validate the predictive learning model's practical effectiveness in simulating the nuanced temporal and contextual dependencies typical of natural speech processing in neural representations. Each component and analysis stage is crucial for assessing the model's alignment with real phonetic decoding processes in the brain.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup\n\n**Objective:** To examine the time window during which the phoneme category of a phone can be decoded from model representations or acoustic features.\n\n**Datasets:**\n- Continuous speech data used for simulation, specific dataset details are not provided in the abstract.\n\n**Baselines:**\n- Acoustic features as a baseline for decoding phoneme categories, specific types of features are not detailed.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\n- Decodability of phoneme identity from model representations and acoustic features over time.\n\n### Main Experimental Results\n\n- **Decodability Duration:** Phoneme identity could be decodable for around 200-400ms, substantially longer than the average phone duration of 80ms. This is consistent with neuroimaging studies findings.\n- **Latency:** Decoding of phonetic features and/or phone identity starts around 10-50ms after phone onset, aligning with the observed timings in brain recordings.\n\nThis setup and result indicate that the model successfully mimics the temporal dynamics and context effects found in neural representations of continuous speech, maintaining phoneme information over an extended period and starting the decoding process shortly after phone onset."
