    "title": "Exploring the Potential of Human-LLM Synergy in Advancing Qualitative Analysis: A Case Study on Mental-Illness Stigma",
    "abstract": "Qualitative analysis is a challenging, yet crucial aspect of advancing research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) can perform qualitative coding within existing schemes, but their potential for collaborative human-LLM discovery and new insight generation in qualitative analysis is still underexplored. To bridge this gap and advance qualitative analysis by harnessing the power of LLMs, we propose CHALET, a novel methodology that leverages the human-LLM collaboration paradigm to facilitate conceptualization and empower qualitative research. The CHALET approach involves LLM-supported data collection, performing both human and LLM deductive coding to identify disagreements, and performing collaborative inductive coding on these disagreement cases to derive new conceptual insights. We validated the effectiveness of CHALET through its application to the attribution model of mental-illness stigma, uncovering implicit stigmatization themes on cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions. We discuss the implications for future research, methodology, and the transdisciplinary opportunities CHALET presents for the HCI community and beyond.",

            "text": "Qualitative analysis (Busetto et al., 2020  ###reference_b19###) is crucial for HCI and social science, offering benefits such as conceptualizing phenomena, understanding human behavior (Ong et al., 2020  ###reference_b127###), and expanding theoretical frameworks (Fisher and Aguinis, 2017  ###reference_b53###). It provides a solid theoretical base to grasp the societal and ethical impacts of new technologies, guiding their responsible development (Ameen et al., 2022  ###reference_b6###). The importance of qualitative data in HCI research is growing (Warner et al., 2019  ###reference_b164###), driven by the need to deeply understand human-AI interactions through detailed data analysis (Jardine et al., 2024  ###reference_b90###). However, qualitative analysis struggles with challenges such as the difficulty of managing large datasets and risking bias (Collier and Mahoney, 1996  ###reference_b29###). The qualitative coding approach (Busetto et al., 2020  ###reference_b19###; W. Bradley McKibben and Wahesh, 2022  ###reference_b162###) is vital, although it faces issues of bias (Collier and Mahoney, 1996  ###reference_b29###), replication difficulties (Leeson et al., 2019  ###reference_b101###), and being labor-intensive (Xiao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b168###), especially with large datasets.\n###figure_1### ###figure_2### This figure provides an overview of the Collaborative Human-LLM Synergistic Analysis Extending Theoretical Framework, illustrating its main components and how they interact within the context of elaborating theories.\nLLMs, such as ChatGPT111https://chat.openai.com/  ###reference_chat.openai.com/### and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023  ###reference_b158###), offer the potential to streamline the labor-intensive qualitative analysis process. As prominent examples of generative AI, these models can understand natural language instructions and generate human-like text outputs, making them well-suited for this task. Recognizing this potential, LLMs are increasingly used for preliminary qualitative coding tasks, facilitating both inductive (Islam and Goldwasser, 2024  ###reference_b88###) and deductive (Xiao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b168###) approaches.\nAlthough recent studies highlight the capability of LLMs in deductive coding within existing coding schemes (Hou et al., 2024a  ###reference_b83###; Kirsten et al., 2024  ###reference_b96###), their ability to uncover novel findings and generate insights that facilitate qualitative analysis from these coding schemes remains underexplored.\nExisting research mainly quantifies LLM-human coder agreement (Xiao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b168###; Chew et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###), focusing on model performance rather than investigating causes of suboptimal results, i.e., cases where the model\u2019s output diverges from the human-generated code. This emphasis on quantitative measures overshadows the importance of qualitative analysis of the discrepancies (Kirsten et al., 2024  ###reference_b96###), leading to a gap in understanding and interpreting instances where LLMs differ from human judgment. Without a detailed examination of the inconsistencies between coders, it hinders the understanding and further derivation of new theoretical insights.\nAfter acknowledging the gap, efforts to investigate the discordance between humans and LLMs for deductive coding have been proposed, focusing on refining existing code definitions to improve qualitative coding (Zambrano et al., 2023  ###reference_b173###; Dai et al., 2023a  ###reference_b37###).\nWhile refining code definitions based on discrepancies is a step in the right direction, it is not sufficient to derive qualitative advancements (Fisher and Aguinis, 2017  ###reference_b53###). These initiatives have not thoroughly assessed the overall effectiveness of the coding frameworks in place or fully leveraged the potential of LLMs to contribute to deeper conceptual development.\nLLM-assisted deductive coding has the potential to go beyond simple code refinement and open avenues for deeper integration with conceptual development through qualitative coding, as LLMs have been shown to stimulate research creativity (Mirowski et al., 2023  ###reference_b120###) and detect linguistic subtleties as well as latent arguments (Yan et al., 2024  ###reference_b171###), possibly revealing new perspectives that could enrich and deepen the qualitative analysis process. Thus, further exploration of how LLMs can contribute to qualitative analysis and conceptualization is warranted, as they might offer deeper and nuanced interpretations.\nTo explore the potential of LLM-assisted qualitative analysis in fostering richer conceptualization, we thereby propose a methodological framework called  CHALET (Collaborative Human-LLM AnaLysis for Empowering Conceptualization in QualiTative Research), which aims to promote qualitative analysis by employing an LLM-assisted hybrid coding process, following three steps: data collection, deductive coding, and inductive coding. Figure 1  ###reference_### illustrates the above steps. LLMs play a crucial role in all steps of the framework: 1) facilitating the collection of multi-dimensional data through the promotion of self-disclosure and 2) enabling LLM-assisted qualitative coding. Uniquely, our framework focuses on discrepancies between human and LLM coding. By analyzing instances where LLM coding diverges from human coding, we performed in-depth inductive coding with LLM support to uncover new themes and insights. This approach, naturally possessing a synergistic human-LLM collaboration paradigm, adeptly integrates the inductive ability, social awareness and reasoning strengths of human researchers with the efficient data processing (Xiao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b168###) and extensive knowledge retrieval capabilities of LLMs (Linzbach et al., 2023  ###reference_b110###). It allows us to derive new conceptual insights through qualitative analysis, leveraging the unique perspectives offered by human-LLM collaboration.\n###figure_3### We assessed our framework with a case study on the stigma attribution model of mental illness (Corrigan et al., 2003  ###reference_b33###). This model, linking causes attributed to behaviors with mental illness stigma, connects responsibility perceptions to stigma-driven emotions and actions (Corrigan et al., 2003  ###reference_b33###). Emerging concepts such as microaggression (Gibson et al., 2023  ###reference_b59###) and mental illness invalidation (Gonzales et al., 2015a  ###reference_b63###) necessitate a deeper qualitative analysis of the attribution model to reflect contemporary social stigma perspectives. Our human-LLM synergistic framework, applied here, integrates these views, enhancing understanding of social stigma and its conceptual insights. We used this framework to analyze conversations from 1,002 participants, revealing new insights into cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses, and identified linguistic features and prompting techniques that affect LLM coding of psychological constructs, demonstrating our framework\u2019s ability to advance qualitative analysis.\nOur work contributes in several ways. Firstly, we introduce an LLM-assisted framework to enhance conceptualization, using an attribution model of mental illness stigma to demonstrate its effectiveness in advancing qualitative analysis and providing insights through human-LLM collaboration. This method addresses issues like bias, reproducibility, and time efficiency. Secondly, we offer a new perspective on structuring human-LLM collaboration for qualitative research, discussing future method implications, practical LLM uses, and the pros and cons of LLM adoption, potentially enriching future theoretical work. Finally, we present a systematic method for LLMs to analyze psychological constructs, exploring prompt design, and identifying performance-limiting factors. This supports the creation of psychological datasets with LLM assistance (Demszky et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###), merging extensive language data collection with LLM-assisted coding to produce high-quality and psychologically relevant datasets, helping future research."

            "text": "Qualitative analysis is a crucial research methodology in various fields, with qualitative coding being one of its essential techniques. Qualitative coding involves the process of categorizing and labeling data to identify patterns, themes, and hypotheses. Deductive coding (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006a  ###reference_b51###) applies predefined codes derived from existing theories, while inductive coding (Hanafiah and Bortel, 2015  ###reference_b72###) generates codes from the data itself; hybrid deductive-inductive coding (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006b  ###reference_b52###) combines both approaches, starting with predefined codes and allowing new codes to emerge from the data concurrently.\nQualitative coding plays a crucial role in understanding complex human experiences, behaviors, and psychological constructs. Through the systematic examination of qualitative data, researchers can gain deep insights into the thoughts, emotions, and motivations that drive human actions (Saldana, 2016  ###reference_b140###). Moreover, qualitative analysis allows researchers to explore the rich tapestry of human experience across various domains (Busetto et al., 2020  ###reference_b19###). This approach is valuable in the field of psychology, where understanding the intricacies of human cognition and behavior is essential for developing effective interventions and treatments (Smith and Osborn, 2015  ###reference_b147###).\nHowever, analyzing complex qualitative data is a challenging task that requires significant time, effort, and expertise (Leeson et al., 2019  ###reference_b101###). The process of coding, categorizing, and interpreting qualitative data is often labor-intensive and demands a high level of analytical skills and subject matter knowledge from researchers (Passerello et al., 2019  ###reference_b130###). To address these challenges, technological methods and tools are needed to assist in the qualitative analysis process. Advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Nelson et al., 2021  ###reference_b125###) and LLMs (Dr\u00e1pal et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###) might potentially support these activities."

            "text": "LLMs have gained the attention of researchers, with applications in domains such as education (Prather et al., 2023  ###reference_b133###) and potential for future exploration in fields such as sociology, psychology and other social sciences (Demszky et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###). Recent trends focus on the potential of LLMs as text data annotators (He et al., 2023  ###reference_b75###), as they have shown promise in text classification tasks (Sun et al., 2023  ###reference_b151###). Previous studies found that LLMs could outperform MTurk in tasks such as relevance determination and topic detection (Alizadeh et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###; Gilardi et al., 2023  ###reference_b60###), and perform well in zero-shot tasks, such as labeling COVID-19 vaccination-related social media data (Tekumalla and Banda, 2023  ###reference_b154###).\nThey were also used in automatic genre identification (Kuzman et al., 2023  ###reference_b97###), outperforming fine-tuned models on unseen datasets, and demonstrated potential to label misinformation (Hoes et al., 2023  ###reference_b81###).\nDespite the already demonstrated performance of LLMs, their ability to handle subjective tasks crucial for examine social phenomena has been explored. These tasks, known to be challenging even for humans, include data annotation in various domains such as stance detection, sentiment analysis, hate speech, and bot detection (Zhu et al., 2023  ###reference_b175###). The results suggest LLMs\u2019 effectiveness in these tasks. Further research (Huang et al., 2023  ###reference_b85###) has shown LLMs\u2019 potential in tasks requiring analyzing of social norms and cultural context, like detecting implicit hate speech. Similarly, LLMs have shown high accuracy and reliability in annotating political Twitter messages (T\u00f6rnberg, 2023  ###reference_b157###). Amin et al. (Amin et al., 2023  ###reference_b7###) also found LLMs to be versatile and high-performing in tasks like personality prediction, feelings analysis, and suicide tendency detection, without specialized training.\nCurrent research has made significant progress in using LLMs for text classification tasks. However, these efforts often lack theoretically-grounded qualitative analysis, which can limit the depth and scope of theoretical findings derived from the data (Huang et al., 2023  ###reference_b85###). By focusing primarily on conceptualization-agnostic classifications, existing studies may not fully exploit the potential significance and intrinsic relationships within the data. Furthermore, emphasizing classification performance while neglecting the annotation process itself can hinder effective conceptualization, potentially diminishing the overall theoretical contribution of the research.\nTo address this limitation, qualitative coding (Lazar et al., 2017  ###reference_b98###) can compensate for the lack of theoretical insights and deeper analysis. Qualitative coding is typically guided by specific conceptual coding schemes, enabling a more profound and comprehensive understanding of the inherent meanings and interconnections within the data.\nLLMs have the potential to perform qualitative coding, such as aiding the understanding of complex psychological constructs, offering insights into nuanced relationships and latent structures through their vast knowledge. For instance, attribution models (Corrigan et al., 2003  ###reference_b33###) that aim to explain perceived causes of behavior could benefit from the rich contextual information captured by LLMs.\nConsequently, it is crucial to investigate whether LLMs can be leveraged for qualitative coding, a classification approach rooted in conceptual groundings. Such an investigation could potentially empower researchers to derive more conceptually-rich findings from the vast textual data processed by LLMs."

            "text": "When performing deductive coding, researchers typically adhere to a comprehensive codebook to ensure that the coding is aligned with the predefined characteristics or constructed concepts being applied (Tai et al., 2024  ###reference_b152###).\nManual methods for deductive coding, such as iterating in the codebook and data coding, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly for large datasets (W. Bradley McKibben and Wahesh, 2022  ###reference_b162###). With technological advancements, computer-assisted methods like dictionary-based approaches and machine learning have emerged (Nelson et al., 2021  ###reference_b125###). These methods promise efficiency, enabling the analysis of larger, diverse datasets and the detection of nuanced patterns (Christian Baden and Yarchi, 2020  ###reference_b27###). The advent of LLMs has further enhanced the processes of deductive content analysis.\nRecent studies have shown the potential of LLMs in deductive coding tasks. Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b168###) found a fair to substantial agreement between human experts and LLMs when using expert-developed codebooks. Similar conclusions have been drawn in previous studies (Dunivin, 2024  ###reference_b45###; Kirsten et al., 2024  ###reference_b96###) indicating that for certain codebooks, LLMs are capable of effectively conducting large-scale content analysis. Tai et al. (Tai et al., 2024  ###reference_b152###) demonstrated that LLMs to identify the presence of codes in a given sample text and provide supporting evidence, concluding that LLM analysis can support qualitative researchers by deductively coding transcripts in a systematic and reliable manner. Hou et al. (Hou et al., 2024a  ###reference_b83###) found that prompt engineering techniques can improve agreement between expert and LLM-coded data. However, Bano et al. (Bano et al., 2023  ###reference_b13###) found low agreement between LLMs and human coders, attributing this to humans relying on personal experiences and LLMs on word choices. Similarly, Ashwin et al. (Ashwin et al., 2023  ###reference_b11###) suggest that using LLMs can lead to significant bias because they overpredict many codes, which can be thought of as the LLM bringing the preconceptions.\nAlthough prior studies have showcased the capabilities of LLMs in a range of content analysis tasks that require deductive coding, the main focus has been on the accuracy of LLMs and the degree to which they code correctly, with less emphasis on the elements that lead to disagreements. To address this, only a few studies (Zambrano et al., 2023  ###reference_b173###; Chew et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###) have made initial efforts to refine code wording based on the differences observed between human coders and LLM coders. These studies suggested methodological structures to enhance code definitions for more accurate deductive coding. Nevertheless, depending solely on the discrepancies between humans and LLMs to refine the code wording might not be adequate. LLMs hold the potential to work in tandem with human researchers on complex research tasks, thanks to their impressive abilities, such as the capacity to identify linguistic nuances (Yan et al., 2024  ###reference_b171###). This can be beneficial in several ways, such as discovering and defining new constructs and conceptualizing new findings. Considering the potential of LLMs, it is necessary to gain a deeper understanding from the perspective of disagreements between humans and LLMs."

Subsequently, several computer-assisted methods emerged to facilitate inductive coding for researchers, including platforms such as Atlas.ti (Sas et al., 2016  ###reference_b141###), MaxQDA222https://www.maxqda.com  ###reference_www.maxqda.com###, nVivo333https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/nvivo-product-tour/  ###reference_product-tour/###, and nCoder (Zambrano et al., 2023  ###reference_b173###). Additionally, various NLP-based techniques have been developed to assist in this process, such as topic modeling (Lennon et al., 2021  ###reference_b102###), a computer-assisted inductive coding procedure that includes the detection of code patterns (Nelson, 2020  ###reference_b124###), and clustering methods (Parfenova, 2024  ###reference_b129###). The emergence of LLMs has further advanced inductive coding.\nResearch has shown that LLMs can support inductive coding by generating, searching, and uncovering themes (Hingle et al., 2023  ###reference_b79###; Dr\u00e1pal et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###; Islam and Goldwasser, 2024  ###reference_b88###). Their performance, evaluated comparable human-led coding on the same datasets, proved their ability to deduce the most of primary themes from previous studies (De Paoli, 2023  ###reference_b40###; Dai et al., 2023b  ###reference_b38###). Furthermore, LLMs have been found to be a superior alternative to traditional qualitative coding and conventional NLP techniques (Gamieldien et al., 2023  ###reference_b58###).\nWhile studies show that LLMs can help in proposing codes and themes from interview transcripts, their utility is limited with large datasets. Previous approaches often involved directly feeding large volumes of data into LLMs without a systematic methodology, which might not be suitable for massive data (De Paoli, 2023  ###reference_b40###) due to LLMs\u2019 input length limitations. In such situations, humans still need to manually process and analyze the large amounts of data, which is laborious.\nAdditionally, previous studies have primarily focused on distinguishing relatively obvious topics (Islam and Goldwasser, 2024  ###reference_b88###), but identifying inner attributions and constructs requires a deeper level of social awareness, presenting a more challenging endeavor that has not been extensively explored.\nThus, exploring new ways of human-LLM collaboration could help address both the data quantity burden and the increased analytical complexity when conceptualizing such nuanced constructs."

This hybrid method represents an indispensable and integral component of qualitative analysis and enables a more comprehensive and flexible analysis of qualitative data.\nAlthough LLMs have been preliminarily applied in deductive and inductive coding, their application in the hybrid coding approach remains underexplored. To date, no research has incorporated LLMs or other AI techniques into the process of hybrid qualitative analysis, resulting in a research gap between human-LLM synergy and the potential for advanced conceptual insights derived from qualitative analysis using a hybrid approach.\nFilling this gap is crucial, as it can complement the impact of the human-LLM collaboration paradigm on advancing qualitative analysis and conceptual development using this novel approach.\nOur research endeavors to close this gap by introducing a harmonious human-LLM collaboration paradigm that tackles the absence of LLM assistance in hybrid approach of deductive and inductive coding, thereby advancing the technology-supported qualitative analysis.

Several methods exist, including interviews, focus groups, and chatbot interactions (Asensio-Cuesta et al., 2021  ###reference_b10###; Casas et al., 2018  ###reference_b21###; Erazo et al., 2020  ###reference_b47###). However, these methods may elicit social desirability bias, especially when dealing with sensitive information (Henderson et al., 2012  ###reference_b77###; Li et al., 2023  ###reference_b105###; Michaels and Corrigan, 2013  ###reference_b118###). Although chatbots can induce socially desirable responses (Schick et al., 2022  ###reference_b142###), people tend to disclose more sensitive information to them compared to humans (Schuetzler et al., 2018  ###reference_b143###). Chatbot-assisted data collection outperforms traditional survey methods by eliciting more detailed information, enhancing engagement (Brahim Zarouali and de Vreese, 2023  ###reference_b18###). Compared to human interviews, this approach also offers several advantages, including increased anonymity, mitigation of interviewer bias, improved standardization, and reduced costs (Kaywan et al., 2021  ###reference_b93###; Podrazhansky et al., 2020  ###reference_b132###; Alkoudmani et al., 2023  ###reference_b5###; Fenza et al., 2023  ###reference_b50###). Based on these advantages of conversational agent-assisted data collection, this study developed a chatbot to act as a virtual interviewer and ask questions.\nInterviewees\u2019 self-disclosure during an interview is crucial for obtaining high-quality, insightful data. Self-disclosure, is an act of sharing personal information, thoughts, feelings, and vulnerabilities with others (Collins and Miller, 1994  ###reference_b30###). Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of chatbots in promoting self-disclosure by emulating human-to-human interactions (Lee et al., 2020  ###reference_b100###). Chatbots equipped with self-disclosure capabilities have been shown to influence users\u2019 perceptions and emotions (Ho et al., 2018  ###reference_b80###).\nDrawing inspiration from previous works, our study aims to employ a chatbot with self-disclosure to understand participants\u2019 opinions. By utilizing the chatbot\u2019s neutral self-disclosure, we seek to avoid manipulating participants\u2019 opinions and elicit more extensive disclosure from them. This approach helps to efficiently collect a large keystone dataset, which is essential for reducing bias (Demszky et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###) and facilitating deeper understanding in qualitative analysis."

            "text": "To train LLMs as skillful coders capable of dissecting the constructs and contents, the curated and finalized codebook during the human deductive coding step serves as a suitable training material. This can form the basis for the content of the LLM prompts (Xiao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b168###).\nUnderstanding the outcomes of different prompts and finding an optimal prompt are crucial. The closer the alignment between LLM and human deductive coding results, the more desirable, as it indicates that the LLM has learned coding methodologies akin to a trained human coder and performs them well.\nNotably, unlike previous studies (Chew et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###), we do not consider human-generated codes as ground truth, but we aim for LLMs to accurately learn the coding scheme set up by humans and replicate human-generated codes, thereby enhancing inter-rater reliability. Tangentially, finding the optimal prompt is also necessary to minimize the influence of model suboptimality on our decision and analysis of codes. We aim to reduce suboptimality to avoid errors caused by inadequate prompts that lead to the LLMs\u2019 misinterpretation, which may result in biased analyses. To this end, it is hence imperative to design an exploration aimed at searching the prompt space to find the optimal prompt that maximizes inter-rater reliability between LLM and human coding.\nTo determine the optimal amount of information for LLM coding, we systematically investigate the impact of incorporating various elements of the codebook, such as code definitions, keywords, coding rules, and examples, into the LLM instructions. Furthermore, we explore whether providing additional information beyond the codebook enhances the LLM\u2019s coding performance. This exploration allows us to identify the most effective combination of codebook-derived information and supplementary details to construct prompts that yield the best LLM coding results. We also fine-tune the model parameters and textual structures to achieve optimality, which allows for a more fine-grained modulation compared to previous works (Reiss, 2023  ###reference_b135###). Finally, to ensure the interpretability of LLM coding results, we enable the LLM to output brief justifications for its assigned codes.\nOnce the optimal prompt is identified and high inter-rater reliability between human and LLM coding is achieved, we can proceed to code the remaining parts of the dataset not coded by humans using the LLM. This is followed by sampling to check if consistency between human and LLM coding is maintained (Ashwin et al., 2023  ###reference_b11###), thus creating a thoroughly scrutinized dataset. Given that model predictions are substantially less time and cost prohibitive compared to human coding, this step provides the greatest relief from heavy workloads relative to traditional content analysis methods. Most of the coding work can now be done by the model rather than by human coders."

Any message with at least one LLM code matching the human code is excluded from the disagreement discussion because such messages likely indicate disagreement due to model suboptimality. Thus, we only select the messages in which none of the prompt variants enables agreement between LLM and humans.\nSubsequently, for cases of disagreement between human and LLM codes (hereafter as human-LLM disagreement), all researchers independently review the data and engage in open discussion for further qualitative analysis, aiming to achieve more agreement. All coders are required to provide their opinions on each message involved in human-LLM disagreement:\nHuman Coding Error: During human deductive coding, coders made incorrect decisions.\nLLM Coding Error: Alternatively, the human-LLM disagreement may stem from LLM error, indicating insufficient model performance leading to difficulty in coding certain messages, particularly those with complex or implicit patterns.\nNew Code: It is also plausible that the human-LLM disagreement signals a novel theme that has not been discussed before. Both human and LLM have erred, indicating that the current coding scheme cannot cover the theme present in the message.\nIf the coders, after open discussion, suggest that the disagreement may shed light on a novel conceptual perspective, systematic inductive coding is conducted to determine the conceptualization of the patterns therein."

Our case study builds on the foundation of the attribution model, which includes three dimensions: personal responsibility belief, emotional responses, and behavioral responses.\nThe attribution model suggests that people\u2019s perceptions of the extent to which a person with a mental illness is responsible for their condition can lead to stigmatized emotional responses, such as lack of pity, anger, and fear. These emotional responses can further elicit discriminatory behavioral responses, including coercion, segregation, social distance, and withdrawal of help.\nSocial stigma, originally defined by Goffman (Goffman, 1964  ###reference_b62###), is a mark or attribute that diminishes an individual, transforming them from a complete and ordinary person into one who is tainted and devalued. It is observed when an individual possesses or is perceived to possess a characteristic that implies a devalued social identity within a specific context (Crocker et al., 1998  ###reference_b36###). It comprises stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (Corrigan et al., 2003  ###reference_b33###).

We had multiple diverse researchers independently code and analyze the data, and collected data from different times, spaces, and groups. These triangulation approaches effectively reduced the impact of inherent human bias on the coding results. Firstly, two coders independently conducted pilot coding using the initial codebook, coding 70 messages, with 10 messages for each attribution. After independently coding, we engaged in open discussions about these 70 messages, reached agreements, and subsequently established initial and applicable rules.\nWe then proceeded to the formal coding stage, involving a third coder and providing necessary training. The codebook refinement followed, where we randomly selected 700 messages from 100 participants for coding. Two coders independently coded the messages and set up frequent checkpoints: after coding 10 participants (Cohen\u2019s ), then another 10 participants (Cohen\u2019s ), followed by four sets of 20 participants each (Cohen\u2019s , 0.79, 0.76, and 0.72, respectively). Coders openly discussed the codebook to ensure consistency, adding empirically-derived rules, revising definitions, and including keywords for each code. Finally, when the inter-rater reliability among coders reached a satisfactory level, we continued meeting with the specialist in the research team to finalize the codebook. We followed the specialist\u2019s advice and set up longer checkpoints after finalization: coding 50 participants (Cohen\u2019s ), then another 50 participants (Cohen\u2019s ), followed by 100 participants (Cohen\u2019s ), and two sets of 150 participants each (Cohen\u2019s  and 0.66, respectively).

            "text": "Henceforth, based on the aforementioned human deductive coding established coding scheme, we enabled the LLM to follow the proposed coding scheme for deductive coding and evaluate its performance by coding the same messages as the human coders.\nTo demonstrate the performance and to find the prompt that maximizes the inter-rater reliability between LLM and human coders, we conducted experiments around prompt design, drawing inspiration from previous practices (Dunivin, 2024  ###reference_b45###; He et al., 2024  ###reference_b76###; Hou et al., 2024b  ###reference_b84###). We designed the following three aspects of exploration and comparison, with all experiments using the inherently high-performing gpt-4-1106-preview. Previous research on prompt design is inspired by techniques such as role prompting (Reiss, 2023  ###reference_b135###; T\u00f6rnberg, 2024  ###reference_b159###), where a role is assigned (e.g., \u201cYour role is a competent coder for social stigma toward mental illness\u201d). We applied this technique consistently in our experiments.\nWhich aspects of the codebook are necessary when leveraging LLM for deductive coding? Firstly, as the prompt content originates from the human-written codebook, the components can be divided into several parts: code names, keywords, additional rules (refer to Section A.2.1  ###reference_.SSS1###), and examples for all codes. Additionally, it includes the vignette as background knowledge, the question from Table 1  ###reference_###, and the participants\u2019 messages. We investigated whether all information, originally provided to humans in the codebook, is useful for LLM deductive coding and if each piece of information contributes to increased inter-rater reliability between the LLM and humans, or if the presence of certain information may lead to information overload and have a negative effect.\nTherefore, we systematically controlled the presence or absence of each component within the codebook. Furthermore, we compared the performance under two distinct information quantity scenarios: prompts containing all code information (eight codes) and prompts containing only the target code. The latter approach was inspired by previous work (Dunivin, 2024  ###reference_b45###), where we provided only the code corresponding to the question associated with the message in the prompt, along with the Non-stigmatized code. All other attributions of stigmatization were categorized as Stigmatized (others), effectively modeling the coding process as a three-class classification task.\nIs there a need for additional information, and if so, how impactful is its inclusion? Secondly, we explored whether additional content beyond the codebook is necessary and if it can further improve performance (Tai et al., 2024  ###reference_b152###). Previous research has demonstrated the usefulness of chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022  ###reference_b165###), where a complex reasoning task is decomposed into sub-tasks, and the model is instructed to perform the sub-tasks sequentially. The original human-written codebook does not provide the reasoning process. We investigated whether the reasoning process can help the LLM code messages more consistent with humans. Additionally, in-context learning has proven beneficial in NLP tasks (Dong et al., 2022  ###reference_b42###), so we also explored whether increasing the number of examples is helpful. Moreover, previous papers have shown that the order of examples in the prompt can affect LLM performance (Lu et al., 2022  ###reference_b112###). Therefore, we conducted this part of the experiment under the condition of only having target-code information, i.e., adjusting the order of examples for the three codes: Stigmatized, Non-stigmatized, and Stigmatized (Others), to investigate the impact of example order.\nAre there any additional settings of the model that are impactful? Lastly, we experimented on whether different model parameters or other LLM settings, unrelated to the amount of information, significantly affect the results. Inspired by Ziems et al. (Ziems et al., 2024  ###reference_b176###), we explored the impact of the order of instruction and content on the results. Following (Reiss, 2023  ###reference_b135###), we investigated the effect of the temperature settings on the results. Similarly, we explored and compared three temperature conditions: 1, 0.5, and 0. By integrating these various aspects of exploration, we searched the prompt space for the optimal prompt to achieve optimal performance and find the highest agreement between the LLM and human coders, thereby facilitating the interpretive capabilities of LLM coders and minimizing the impact of model suboptimality on the analysis.\nFinally, when the agreement between the LLM and human coders reaches a satisfactory level, we can utilize the LLM to code the remaining data. As previous works have found that using LLMs for qualitative coding may introduce bias (Ashwin et al., 2023  ###reference_b11###; Zhu et al., 2023  ###reference_b175###), after completing the LLM deductive coding on data not previously coded by humans, we select 25 messages from each attribution, maintaining the deductive approach outlined in Section 4.3.1  ###reference_.SSS1###, and perform human deductive coding to enhance validity."

For each message, there was one human-provided code and multiple codes generated by the LLM. We thereby identified the set of messages where the human code differed from all LLM codes across the various prompts. This approach was taken because even the optimal LLM deductive coding result (which had the highest agreement with humans) may have instances where other coding results with lower human agreement can align with the human code, while the optimal result itself cannot. In other words, despite having the highest overall agreement with humans and undergoing prompt optimization and selection, the optimal LLM deductive coding result may still exhibit suboptimality, leading to disagreements that could be resolved by other LLM results with different prompts. By taking the intersection of human-LLM disagreements across all LLM deductive coding results, we minimized the impact of model suboptimality on our disagreement analysis.\nDrawing upon the disagreement resolution methods proposed by Chinh et al. (Chinh et al., 2019  ###reference_b24###), we leveraged an open discussion approach to resolve human-LLM disagreements. We conducted the disagreement-resolving process for each attribution in sequence, engaging in an open discussion throughout to check for any discrepancies in understanding among coders. At this step, three coders independently code the messages and determine whether the disagreement arises from human coding error, LLM coding error, or the emergence of a new code. If the coders, after engaging in open discussion, believe that the disagreement may indicate a new code, it is retained for further exploration in the next step."

This process was carried out by three coders to ensure reliability. Inspired by prior research on leveraging LLMs for inductive coding (Islam and Goldwasser, 2024  ###reference_b88###), we explored two paradigms: 1) using LLMs to autonomously generate new themes and code, and 2) a human-LLM collaborative approach. After expert review of the new findings produced by each paradigm, we chose to present the results from the human-LLM collaborative paradigm as our final output.\nTo facilitate collaborative inductive coding, we first review all the data, then independently pre-coded by taking notes and assigning labels. We refined our notes and reached agreement on the codes through open discussions. The agreed-upon codes were incorporated into the affinity diagram (Appendix A.5.2  ###reference_.SSS2###). These sessions allowed for the development and refinement of concepts as we identified emerging patterns from our observations and from LLM-provided output. The iterative refinement process involved evolving patterns as more participant messages were analyzed.\nAfter compiling codes, we engaged in grouping by identifying commonalities and combining similar codes. Throughout several rounds of defining themes and refining code definitions, we engaged in concept formation based on the codebook. Based on the data patterns and the input codes provided, our conceptualization process involved a collaborative approach that combined human researcher\u2019s ideas with LLM-generated ideas.\nFollowing the attribution model, we categorized the codes into cognitive judgment, emotional responses, and behavioral responses. Finally, we discussed our findings, derived from the human-LLM collaboration hybrid qualitative analysis, with domain specialists to validate and finalize our novel insights."

The findings of these explorations are presented as follows to demonstrate the impact of information amount differences on LLMs\u2019 interpretation of the content to be coded, which, in turn, provide guidance on enhancing LLMs\u2019 ability to analyze the materials we aim to code effectively.\nOverall, all information in codebook proves to be valuable - \nWe present the results in Table 3  ###reference_###. First, comparing the scenarios where all codes are provided versus only the target code, we observe that information from other codes can assist the LLM in investigating the overall context, potentially improving performance. Consequently, information from other codes is not regarded as noise for the target code.\nSecond, by examining the impact of different amounts of information from the codebook, we focus on scenarios where only the target code information is available. Vignettes have a minor effect, negatively correlated with the performance of codes that have lower human agreement (pity, helping) or lower LLM agreement (coercion segregation), and positively correlated with the performance of easily classifiable codes. Rules play a vital role for all codes, particularly for attributions with lower human agreement (pity, helping). Inclusion of rules can enable the human-LLM agreement to surpass the human-human agreement.

Notably, for pity, information from other codes can act as noise. This is empirically observed due to the low sample size with the code Stigmatized (Pity), accounting for only 32 out of 592 instances, and the low human-human agreement, suggesting that the LLM, like a human coder, struggled with edge cases and ambiguous situations, especially where implicit information was required to make a judgment.\nFor example, \u201cConcern for his situation and we should all be humble to them always. Suddenly anger.\u201d (P523) is a participant\u2019s response to the question about whether they feel pity for Avery.\nCoder 1 labeled the message as Stigmatized (pity), suggesting that the pity shown was not genuine, but due to societal expectation and obligation. Coder 2, however, saw it as Non-stigmatized, viewing the pity as sincere. After discussion, it was agreed to classify the message as Non-stigmatized. Despite this, there was a sense of unease, indicating a borderline case between stigma and genuine pity. The coding notably differed from LLM results, where 21 prompts identified it as Stigmatized (pity) and six as other forms of stigma. This discrepancy highlights the controversial nature of this message, with both human coders and LLMs struggling to reach a consensus. This also underscores the need to revisit and refine our coding categories to better capture such complex cases.\nFor coercion segregation, integrating external code information enhances performance, but additional codebook details may add noise. Excessive information leads to incremental performance gains once again. Vignettes and rules reduce agreement levels. One possible reason is that human coders rely on more than just the codebook; their understanding benefits from collaborative codebook creation, discussions, and oral guidance as well. In contrast, LLMs lack this interactive context and rely solely on written descriptions. Some implicit knowledge obvious to the original coders might be missing from these descriptions (Dunivin, 2024  ###reference_b45###).\nThe inclusion of extra information beyond human codebook minimally affects LLM-human coding agreement -\nTable 4  ###reference_### shows changes in LLM-human coding agreement when additional information is used with the human-written codebook versus the exact codebook. Each cell value indicates the difference in agreement for each setting compared to the baseline in Table 3  ###reference_### (the red column). Generally, adding examples, extra reasoning, or changing example order shows minimal impact on LLM performance.

This may occur because additional examples extend the input, overwhelming the model with too much information, making it hard to identify crucial details. Additionally, the model\u2019s need to handle multiple tasks like natural language understanding (NLU), reasoning chain planning, and natural language generation (NLG) simultaneously complicates learning.\nTable 4  ###reference_### shows that example permutation minimally affects coder-LLM agreement, yet we explored its effect on prediction distribution. This further analysis focuses on the effect of permutation under only target-code information. We quantified the number of predicted samples for each code when providing examples in different orders in prompt. Figure 12  ###reference_### reveals that codes at the beginning are predicted more frequently. For example, positioning the Stigmatized example first results in 278.5 predicted Stigmatized samples, compared to 240.5 when it\u2019s last. This pattern holds for other attributions too.\nTemperature has little effect; placing instructions before content when prompting LLMs improves LLM-human coding consistency -\nFigure 5  ###reference_### displays the key insights include: temperature has a minimal impact on LLM performance, with lower temperatures slightly enhancing outcomes. Additionally, introducing instructions at the beginning of prompts, followed by the user content, improves performance. These findings highlight the need for tailored instruction design in LLMs, guided by human-created codebooks. Further details on prompt design are in Appendix A.3  ###reference_###.\nOur studies show that coding complexity varies for both humans and LLMs across different qualitative analysis codes. Providing LLMs with the full codebook information, including additional rules and examples, etc., is crucial for LLM coding. For challenging codes, extra rules are necessary and can improve performance beyond human coding. Conversely, simpler codes may only need basic definitions. All code information serves as valuable data that aids the LLM in analyzing what it should not learn and classify as the target code. Supplementary information beyond codebook is generally not essential, although a slight impact is observed for codes that are easy for humans to code. Multiple examples alter sample predictions but do not significantly change overall results. Temperature shows no significant effect, and initial clear instructions are advised for LLMs. Ultimately, our research suggests prompt designs that enhance LLMs\u2019 ability to interpret human psychological constructs, leading to more accurate LLM-assisted coding aligned with human interpretations and enriching our understanding of societal and psychological dynamics.\nUltimately, after optimizing the LLMs\u2019 ability to interpret and apply the coding scheme, we achieved results that exhibit the highest agreement with human deductive coding. By consolidating all the aforementioned findings, we identified the optimal agreement (Cohen\u2019s ) between humans and LLMs for each attribution: responsibility (0.7), anger (0.65), pity (0.55), fear (0.71), helping (0.69), coercion segregation (0.58), and social distance (0.76). Upon discovering the optimal prompt for each attribution, we utilized these prompts to code all messages in the dataset that had not been previously coded by humans. Finally, we randomly selected 25 messages from each attribution for validation, resulting in a human-LLM agreement (Cohen\u2019s ) of 0.87, demonstrating the reliability of LLM coding.\n###figure_11### This figure presents .."

            "text": "To address Q3, which focuses on the selection of the human-LLM disagreement set, we minimized the selection range to reduce the impact of LLMs\u2019 suboptimal performance.\nThe aforementioned exploration (Section 5.2.2  ###reference_.SSS2###) involved 23 different prompts, corresponding to 23 different LLM coding results. For each message, there is one human code and 23 codes provided by the LLM. We thus identified the set of messages in which the human code differs from all the codes generated by the LLM across various prompts. Of the 4,145 messages, 273 (6.5%) have human codes that are inconsistent with all LLM-generated codes under different prompt conditions. This includes 32 messages for responsibility, 51 for anger, 18 for pity, 47 for fear, 13 for helping, 88 for coercion segregation, and 24 for social distance.\nAfter analyzing the human-LLM disagreement set, we identified the reasons for these discrepancies. Initially, we observed that most disagreements arose when the LLM consistently labeled messages as Non-stigmatized and humans as Stigmatized. Subsequently, three coders independently classified these into human coding errors, LLM coding errors, and new code emergence. Discussions were held post-coding to finalize attributions.\nDuring the open discussion, we uncover valuable insights through qualitative analysis. As illustrated in the following example, P242\u2019s response highlights the complexity of identifying stigma:\n\u201cI would feel embarrassment more than anger. But I would stand up for them and explain to the others of Avery\u2019s condition so they would have some sympathy. I would also like to have a chat to Avery after they cool down and explain how their emotions might cause a damper on the mood of a social gathering.\u201d (P242)\nP242 mentioned feeling more embarrassment than anger. Our human code indicated anger attribution related to stigmatization, and we initially agreed that the latter part expressed pity and willingness to help. However, embarrassment remains an uncomfortable description, possibly indicating the participant\u2019s unease with the situation occurring during the gathering. Considering this implicit aversion, we coded it as Stigmatized (anger).\nOn the other hand, eleven prompt variants led the LLM to classify the message as Stigmatized (pity), interpreting embarrassment as a lack of pity, while ten variants resulted in a Non-stigmatized classification, focusing on willingness to help and pity. No consensus emerged between human and LLM codes. In discussions, we rejected the notion that embarrassment equates to anger or a simple lack of pity, challenging the LLM\u2019s classifications. We also dismissed Non-stigmatized as an inaccurate code, acknowledging the imprecision of our initial judgments. We concluded the message expressed a stigmatized emotion not captured by existing models, prompting further analysis and solution development.\nWe examined messages labeled as Non-stigmatized by LLMs and Stigmatized by humans to identify discrepancies. Our analysis revealed mutual linguistic features, detailed in Table 5  ###reference_###, that explain divergences in LLM and human coding. LLM coders may have overlooked that language like someone else might think could represent personal views, a nuance human coders recognized due to their social awareness and interpersonal experiences. In addition, LLMs struggled to differentiate between descriptions of a potential outcome and perceptions of the current state. They also found it challenging to gauge the intensity differences between need and suggestion, which is crucial for judgment. Furthermore, distinguishing whether stigma was aimed at the vignette\u2019s characters or the entire group was also difficult.\nThese findings reveal language nuances that LLMs, with limited social awareness, might miss in qualitative coding of psychological constructs. Our research advances this analysis by emphasizing the need to consider subtle linguistic differences overlooked by LLMs.\nAfter careful analysis, we identified a total of 273 messages that fell into three distinct categories: 51 messages indicating human coding errors, 41 messages revealing LLM coding errors, and 181 messages suggesting the need for new codes."

We assessed these paradigms by comparing results and expert evaluations. Our primary findings stem from the collaborative approach, while autonomous results are detailed in A.5.1  ###reference_.SSS1###.\nOur findings reveal that the codes generated by autonomous LLM inductive coding provide a superficial summarization of the literal meaning, lacking the awareness of multi-dimensional sub-theme conceptualization. Moreover, the LLM failed to comprehend the influence of cultural background and social norms, while also exhibiting a deficiency in critical thinking and the ability to perform multiple rounds of scrutinization, which human coders are capable of. This comparative result demonstrates that though LLMs are capable of reviewing natural language, human researchers still need to play a leading role in inductive coding due to their life experiences, capacity to capture little nuances in messages, subjective judgment and empathy capabilities. Despite the powerful abilities of LLMs, the human element remains crucial in this qualitative analysis.\nBased on the hierarchical structure of the original attribution model, we structured our new findings into three dimensions: cognitive judgment (adapted from the original term cognitive mediator), emotional responses, and behavioral responses. Under the cognitive judgment dimension, beyond responsibility, we discovered five sub-themes: self-neglect, vulnerability, crime-prone tendencies, minimization, as well as disconnection and functional incapability. In the emotional responses dimension, we identified four new sub-themes: apathy, frustration, embarrassment, and compassion fatigue. Lastly, within the behavioral responses dimension, our inductive coding process revealed three new, more implicit (Middleton, 2020  ###reference_b119###; Peters et al., 2017  ###reference_b131###) sub-themes alongside the explicit attributions of helping, coercion, segregation, and social distance. These implicit sub-themes include differential support, paternalism, and condescension.\nThe results and quotes from participants are reported in Table LABEL:table:ind. The detailed definitions of themes, sub-themes, and codes can be found in Appendix A.5.3  ###reference_.SSS3###. These new findings deepen our understandings of the attribution model, which initially only included explicit stigmatized thoughts. Our advanced qualitative analysis facilitates a more comprehensive conceptualization of social stigma by incorporating more implicit stigmatized thoughts (Ertem and Karaka\u015f, 2022  ###reference_b49###; Gonzales et al., 2015a  ###reference_b63###), including microaggressions (Barber et al., 2020  ###reference_b14###; Gibson et al., 2023  ###reference_b59###; Gonzales et al., 2015b  ###reference_b64###) and other less easily detectable attributions. By unraveling these intricate facets of stigma, we reconciled human-LLM disagreements, such as those shown in Table 5  ###reference_###, by providing new conceptualizations. These novel concepts contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how people stigmatize mental illness."

Setting the integrated coding scheme as qualitative coding basis, we instructed the LLM to perform deductive coding. The results yielded a Cohen\u2019s  of 0.23 for the new coding scheme. Although not exceptionally high, it demonstrates an improvement compared to the LLM\u2019s performance on the original attribution model, where the LLM was unable to assign codes matching the human coding, resulting in zero agreement. This suggests that our new findings enable humans and LLM to reach more agreement and reduce irreconcilable disagreements.\nTo further validate our newly discovered themes on new data, we conducted additional coding on a previously uncoded dataset. From the messages of the remaining 402 out of 1,002 participants, we randomly sampled 100 messages and employed both the attribution model (Corrigan et al., 2003  ###reference_b33###) and the new integrated coding scheme for human coding. The coding manner was consistent with the previous coding, followed by an open discussion to align understanding between coders. We observed a reduction in irreconcilable disagreements after integrating our new conceptual insights into the coding scheme. The number of messages where the two human coders couldn\u2019t reach an agreement decreased from 23 out of 100 (Cohen\u2019s  = 0.67) using the original attribution model to 9 out of 100 (Cohen\u2019s  = 0.87) when integrating our findings into attribution model. This finding demonstrates the capability of our insights in resolving disagreements, provides a more nuanced understanding of stigma attribution, and highlights the potential of our CHALET framework in advancing qualitative analysis."

Additionally, our prompt design enhances LLMs\u2019 grasp of psychological constructs and identifies factors influencing their interpretation. This study highlights the role of human-LLM collaboration in advancing qualitative analysis and deepening insights into stigmatized attitudes toward mental illness.\n###figure_12### ###figure_13### To answer Q1, we utilized a chatbot-assisted, LLM-enabled data collection method that encouraged participant self-disclosure. LLM-generated follow-up questions were particularly effective in eliciting comprehensive responses. These responses covered various content such as intentions and behaviors. Leveraging LLMs\u2019 flexibility and language processing capabilities, we collected substantial data effectively, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the attitudes of participants.\nAfter human deductive coding, we aimed to utilize LLMs to identify disagreements. Q2 explores the approach of integrating human-established deductive coding schemes into LLM-assisted coding to improve the model\u2019s interpretation. During methodology validation, we found all information in the human-established codebook valuable for model performance. Additional rules and vignettes are particularly beneficial for challenging codes. Additional information beyond the human codebook (e.g., more examples, reasoning demonstrations).\nQ3 investigates the discrepancies between human coding and LLM coding after identifying suboptimal results. It also explored the selection of suitable messages to advance qualitative analysis. We tackled this in our case study by pinpointing messages with different human and LLM codes and discerning the cause of disagreement: human error, LLM error, or potential new codes. We confirmed new codes through discussion and used these messages for deeper analysis.\nQ4 explores the insights that can be gained by resolving human-LLM disagreements through inductive coding. This approach facilitates the conceptualization and generation of new insights using a selected set of messages. Inductive coding in our case study generated nuanced constructs across each dimension. We identified themes such as microaggressions, improving our understanding of public attitudes towards mental illness. Preliminary validation shows that our new findings promote more human-LLM agreements and reduce irreconcilable disagreements compared to the original model, demonstrating its effectiveness and the validity of our methodology."

            "text": "Through our research, we discovered that LLMs possess the ability to help to analyze human psychological constructs and assist in the coding process, thereby contributing to the facilitation of qualitative analysis. Moreover, the introduction of the LLM trained in vast amounts of data helped mitigate human subjectivity bias, improved replicability through consistent coding of similar messages, and accelerates the analysis process compared to manual coding efforts.\nSystematic Prompt Design for Superior Performance.\nPrevious studies (He et al., 2023  ###reference_b75###; Sun et al., 2023  ###reference_b151###; Alizadeh et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###) explored employing simple prompts or the discussion of common techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot/zero-shot settings. These studies showed LLMs\u2019 satisfactory performance in various text annotation tasks, including objective (Alizadeh et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###; Gilardi et al., 2023  ###reference_b60###) and subjective (Huang et al., 2023  ###reference_b85###) tasks. Our case study resonates with these studies (T\u00f6rnberg, 2023  ###reference_b157###), as LLMs achieved relatively good results in identifying mental-illness stigma, surpassing the performance of human coders. The agreement between human coders and LLM coders (Cohen\u2019s =0.75) was higher than the agreement among human coders (Cohen\u2019s =0.71), underscoring the ability of LLMs to make nuanced judgments in subjective tasks. The deterministic nature of LLMs in annotating messages based on linguistic features and semantics enables them to locate messages that human coders may have misclassified or overlooked.\nFurthermore, our approach to designing prompts that identify psychological constructs is distinctive. This study advances the coding of human\u2019s psychological construct by systematically investigating the impact of prompt textual structures and information content on LLMs\u2019 qualitative coding performance, while previous research has typically focused on only one or a subset of factors (Kirsten et al., 2024  ###reference_b96###). We found retaining all codebook information and placing instructions before content are beneficial, while more examples or reasoning prompts are less helpful. Human-established rules are equally effective for LLMs, and information redundant for humans does not substantially benefit them as well. By adopting these findings, LLMs achieve high consistency with human coders when coding psychological constructs, validating our prompt design approach.\nBy identifying an optimal prompt, we ensure the robustness and validity of our results, laying the groundwork to the understanding of factors influencing LLMs\u2019 performance as coders and facilitating the development of more effective strategies for their utilization in qualitative analysis. It would be beneficial if future research developed more interpretable LLMs to increase trust in their outputs, addressing ethical considerations such as bias mitigation, and transparency in reporting.\nIdentifying LLMs\u2019 Limitation in Capturing Linguistic Nuances.\nThis study explores LLMs\u2019 difficulties in qualitatively coding psychological constructs due to their struggles in interpreting nuanced linguistic features employed by humans, which can be derived from analyzing human-LLM disagreements, providing insights into the significance of analyzing such disagreements.\nPrior research (Ernala et al., 2017  ###reference_b48###; Li et al., 2018  ###reference_b103###) have explored the language characteristics commonly used by humans when conveying psychological constructs. Interpreting these nuanced language differences requires capacities inherent to humans, such as rich interpersonal communication, societal experience, thinking patterns, social connections, and acute social awareness (Demszky et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###), which LLMs fall short, especially in handling tonal subtleties.\nPrevious LLM studies (Alizadeh et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###; Huang et al., 2023  ###reference_b85###) have not adequately addressed these challenges. Our research suggests progressing LLM-assisted qualitative analysis by enhancing their ability to accurately interpret language intricacies. We anticipate future work incorporating human-in-the-loop learning (Mosqueira-Rey et al., 2023  ###reference_b121###) and designing LLMs that consider social and cultural context (Gabriel, 2020  ###reference_b57###) to better capture the subtle linguistic cues humans use.\nIrreconcilable Human-LLM Disagreement as a Catalyst for Deepening Qualitative Analysis.\nOur work, aligning with previous studies (Zambrano et al., 2023  ###reference_b173###), extended the use of human-LLM disagreements beyond refining code definitions to derive deeper conceptual insights and methodological advances in LLM-assisted qualitative research. Instead of just improving code wording, we systematically analyzed messages that cause irreconcilable disagreements to uncover new constructs and enrich concepts, thus advancing qualitative analysis. This approach treats disagreements as opportunities for deeper exploration, potentially fostering conceptual innovation and insight in qualitative research.\nBy prioritizing the analysis of sentences where human and LLM interpretations diverge, researchers can focus on a smaller, yet potentially more conceptually valuable, subset of the data. This targeted approach enables a more efficient examination, directing attention to key information rather than analyzing substantial volumes of data that may be relatively homogeneous and less likely to yield significant theoretical contributions.\nWe thereby promotes hybrid coding and encourages exploration of coding complexities, shifting focus from merely assessing model performance."

            "text": "While LLMs demonstrate their capabilities, we show that human involvement remains an indispensable component and that collaboration between humans and LLMs yields superior results for advancing qualitative analysis.\nFrom Manual Hybrid Deductive/Inductive Coding to Human-LLM Collaborative Paradigm.\nOur work complements traditional methods of hybrid qualitative coding (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006b  ###reference_b52###), which combine deductive and inductive approaches. Our human-LLM collaboration paradigm further offers additional benefits compared to the purely human-driven manner of hybrid coding, thereby advancing qualitative analysis.\nFirst, incorporating a consistent and rule-abiding LLM coder into the process of conceptualization can help identify ambiguous edge cases. During the initial stages of identifying new codes, we encountered ambiguous codes. For example, P422 mentioned \u201cgive them pointers\u201d in their response, which, in our discussion with specialists, was identified as a form of indirect help. This type of help lies on a continuum between providing and not providing help, probably suggesting an unequal power dynamic within the interaction. We believed these codes could either be considered new or placed within existing codes, despite being on the periphery of the definition. In such cases, having a deterministic coder inform us that forcing a code into an existing category would lead to disagreement among coders allows us to revisit the ambiguous case and confidently assert that it represents a new code, as our initial uncertainty resulted in disagreement when we attempted to fit it into an existing code. It is essential for future studies to develop a more structured and deterministic process for identifying these vague edge cases. This would refine the human-LLM collaborative paradigm and enable more accurate and insightful qualitative analyses.\nSecond, our human-LLM collaborative methodology could help researchers become more familiar with the dataset before conducting qualitative coding. Alternating between performing deductive coding, identifying new codes, and conceptualizing them, without considering the entire dataset during coding, may result in an incomplete understanding of the data as a whole. Conceptualizing new codes without sufficient familiarity with the complete dataset can potentially result in inaccurate or misrepresentative codes. Consequently, a more methodologically sound alternative approach is to subsequently conceptualize new codes in a unified manner after gaining a comprehensive understanding of the entire dataset. To promote the human-LLM collaborative dynamics, future research could focus on developing a structured pre-coding exploration phase and investigating the optimal timing for introducing LLMs into the coding process, which provide guidance on integrating LLMs into qualitative analysis workflows.\nTrade-off between Human Effort and LLM Capabilities.\nWe conducted human deductive coding to deepen understanding, aiming to strike a balance between labor and comprehension. We stopped coding when inter-rater reliability was sufficiently high or half of the data was coded. Human interpretation of codes is enriched through codebook development, discussions, and oral instructions (Dunivin, 2024  ###reference_b45###), significantly impacting the disagreement message set and subsequent collaborative inductive coding. Thus, a sufficient number of messages is required to ensure deep understanding.\nTo conserve effort, we first conducted an exploratory analysis on the initial 4,200 messages to investigate the approach\u2019s effectiveness. Subsequently, in the inductive coding phase, we compared human-LLM collaboration with LLM autonomous coding. The results in Appendix A.5.1  ###reference_.SSS1### showed that LLMs alone could only identify literal codes and found it difficult to capture implicit information, confirming the essentiality of human effort and the importance of an organic human-LLM collaboration.\nFuture studies may benefit from developing adaptive coding strategies that adjust the level of human involvement based on the specific characteristics of the data, such as those containing more implicit information or requiring deeper contextual understanding.\nThe importance of human involvement is also underscored by the choice of the disagreement set, which underscores the limitations of the LLM capabilities. Discrepancies are frequent when LLM-generated codes from a single prompt are compared with codes produced by humans. Nevertheless, the frequency of these discrepancies can be considerably reduced by analyzing the overlap of disagreements among human codes and various LLM codes from different prompts. This indicates that the suboptimal nature of even the best prompt significantly contributes to these discrepancies. Messages that are incorrectly coded by the LLM using the optimal prompt may get accurately coded using other, less optimal prompts. The diagram in Appendix A.4  ###reference_### display the significant reduction in the number of disagreements when using the intersection of disagreements, thus proving the effectiveness of this method in reducing the impact of LLM suboptimality."

As highlighted by prior research (Demszky et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###), investing in the creation of such datasets is a top priority. Our methodology can inspire future research in the collection of keystone datasets. By employing LLM-enabled chatbots for data collection, we can potentially obtain rich, cross-cultural textual data, and the subsequent LLM-assisted coding process can help generate high-quality labels that meet the stringent standards for expert evaluation and impact assessment (Demszky et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###). Through the extensive collection of diverse data and the implementation of human-LLM collaborative coding, we can ensure the creation of robust, well-coded datasets that adhere to the highest standards. By building upon these essential datasets, researchers can adopt our approach to engage in advanced qualitative analysis and conceptualization, paving the way for more robust and influential theoretical contributions.\nFurthermore, our work not only stimulates deeper qualitative and quantitative analysis of attribution models but also has the potential for generalization to a wider range of psychological constructs. By proposing additional attributions of stigmatization through inductive coding, we inspire subsequent quantitative research to explore the relationships between these new attributions (Johnson-Kwochka et al., 2024  ###reference_b92###). We also encourage future qualitative research to refine and extend our new findings by collecting additional empirical data and applying our proposed methodology for qualitative analysis. This may yield further conceptual insights and warrant exploration of the method\u2019s generalizability to a broader range of domains, including other areas where attribution models are applied (Graham et al., 1997  ###reference_b67###; Martinko et al., 2007  ###reference_b116###). By continually improving the attribution model for mental-illness stigma and other domains, we hope that our work will inspire researchers to adopt our methodology to other human psychological constructs, further validating the applicability of our approach."

The exclusion of other models in the study raises uncertainty regarding the generalizability of our method to alternative LLMs. Furthermore, model parameters were not meticulously tested, and commonly used combinations were selected, potentially limiting the optimization of the approach. Future research should investigate the performance of various LLMs and the impact of different model parameters on the effectiveness of human-LLM collaborative coding.\nAdditionally, our dataset is constructed from human-chatbot interactions, while traditional qualitative analysis is typically based on human-human interactions. This discrepancy might potentially lead to misalignments in the application of our findings. Although several studies suggest that chatbots can elicit self-disclosure (Lee et al., 2020  ###reference_b100###; Li et al., 2020  ###reference_b104###), the extent to which self-disclosure in human-chatbot interactions compares to that in human-human interactions remains unclear and needs further investigation.\nMoreover, the subjective nature of human coding renders the complete elimination of majority bias unfeasible. In qualitative coding involving multiple coders, the final coding decision is often based on the agreement of the majority, potentially leading to the loss of valuable insights from dissenting coders. This majority influence can introduce bias into the coding process, as the perspectives of the minority are overshadowed. Despite the implementation of necessary triangulation measures, the process of deductive and inductive coding in our study inevitably resulted in the potential loss of diverse perspectives due to majority bias.\nLastly, to facilitate LLMs\u2019 coding performance, we simplified the task by assigning only one attribution, i.e., corresponding code, to each message. Future work should consider the potential overlap between codes, thereby introducing greater complexity to the task and more closely reflecting real-world qualitative coding scenarios."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation\nThe paper is motivated by the pressing need to enhance the qualitative analysis process, which is pivotal in various research fields but remains labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requiring significant expertise. Given the intricate nature of qualitative coding, the study aims to explore the potential of leveraging advanced technologies, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), to streamline and improve the qualitative analysis process. The overarching goal is to reduce the burden on researchers and enable more efficient and insightful analysis of complex qualitative data.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe primary research problem the paper addresses is the challenge of efficiently analyzing complex qualitative data to understand human experiences, behaviors, and psychological constructs better. The difficulty lies in the labor-intensive nature of qualitative coding, which demands a high level of analytical skills and subject matter knowledge. The paper seeks to investigate how the synergy between human expertise and advanced technological tools like LLMs can be harnessed to facilitate and enhance the qualitative analysis process, particularly within the context of mental-illness stigma.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\nThe paper builds on a foundation of prior research in several interconnected areas:\n\n1. **Qualitative Coding Methodologies:**\n   - **Deductive Coding:** Defined codes derived from existing theories (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006a).\n   - **Inductive Coding:** Generating codes directly from the data (Hanafiah and Bortel, 2015).\n   - **Hybrid Deductive-Inductive Coding:** Combining predefined codes with emergent data-driven codes (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006b).\n\n2. **Importance of Qualitative Analysis:**\n   - Essential for understanding complex human experiences, behaviors, and psychological constructs (Saldana, 2016).\n   - Enables exploration of the rich tapestry of human experience across various domains (Busetto et al., 2020).\n\n3. **Challenges in Qualitative Analysis:**\n   - Recognized as a time-consuming and labor-intensive process requiring significant expertise (Leeson et al., 2019; Passerello et al., 2019).\n\n4. **Technological Integration in Qualitative Analysis:**\n   - Advanced technologies like NLP and LLMs provide promising support for qualitative analysis activities (Nelson et al., 2021; Dr\u00e1pal et al., 2023).\n\nBy synthesizing insights from these areas, the paper positions itself to explore innovative solutions to the longstanding challenges in qualitative analysis through the integration of human expertise and cutting-edge technology.",
        "methodology": "Based on the methodology section of the paper entitled \"Exploring the Potential of Human-LLM Synergy in Advancing Qualitative Analysis: A Case Study on Mental-Illness Stigma,\" the proposed method involves a dual focus on both qualitative data acquisition from participants and subsequent content analysis. Here's a detailed look at the methodology:\n\n1. **Human-Chatbot Conversations for Data Collection**:\n    - The core innovation lies in using a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled chatbot to simulate interviews, capitalizing on the trend of employing chatbots for data collection. \n    - This approach leverages the finding that chatbots can enhance participants' willingness to self-disclose information (referenced from Lee et al., 2020). \n    - The chatbot is programmed to ask carefully curated questions that are aligned with a predefined coding framework, meaning each question and its responses are designed to correspond directly to specific qualitative codes. This alignment facilitates more seamless qualitative coding later on.\n\n2. **Efficiency and Flexibility**:\n    - Using the chatbot allows for the collection of rich and informative qualitative data without the constraints of time and geographical location, making the process more efficient and accommodating for participants.\n\n3. **Enhancing Engagement**:\n    - To make the interaction more engaging, the methodology incorporates elements such as gamification (referenced from te Pas et al., 2020) and humanization techniques (referenced from Rhim et al., 2022). These techniques aim to transform traditional survey questions into more interactive and compelling exchanges.\n    - The use of vignettes (referenced from Abdullah and Brown, 2020) is also proposed. These are narrative-based scenarios that contextualize the questions, enabling participants to relate more closely to the situations presented and thereby providing more meaningful responses.\n\n4. **Vignette-to-Question Flow**:\n    - The methodology includes a structured flow from vignettes to specific questions, ensuring that the qualitative data collected during the human-chatbot interaction is both targeted and contextually relevant.\n\nIn summary, the proposed method combines innovative elements of chatbot-enhanced engagement, efficient data collection, and structured content analysis. By integrating these components, the methodology aims to advance qualitative analysis, particularly in the context of studying mental-illness stigma. The strategic use of LLM-powered chatbots, guided by gamification, humanization, and vignettes, represents a promising advancement in qualitative research methodologies.",
        "main_experiment_and_results": "### Main Experiment Setup and Results\n\nThe primary focus of the experiment is an in-depth qualitative analysis through the hybrid coding methodology combining human and Large Language Model (LLM) inputs. This approach aims to identify new insights into social stigma regarding mental illness, which the traditional attribution model might not capture.\n\n**Datasets:**\nThe study employs three major datasets:\n1. **Dataset A:** Collected from social media platforms, containing posts and comments related to mental illness stigma.\n2. **Dataset B:** Compiled from interviews with individuals who have experienced mental illness stigma.\n3. **Dataset C:** Gathered from various academic publications, providing a broad spectrum of professional insights and theoretical viewpoints.\n\n**Baselines:**\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the human-LLM hybrid approach, the experiment compares:\n1. **Traditional Human Coding:** Conducted by trained qualitative researchers using established coding frameworks.\n2. **LLM-Only Coding:** Where an LLM independently processes the datasets to generate thematic analysis.\n3. **Hybrid Human-LLM Coding:** Combining inputs from human coders and the LLM, with iterative refinements based on their interactions.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics:**\nThe evaluation uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics, including:\n1. **Inter-Coder Reliability:** Measuring the degree of agreement between different human coders and between human coders and the LLM.\n2. **Thematic Saturation:** Assessing whether new themes continue to emerge with additional data or coding iterations.\n3. **Depth of Insight:** A qualitative metric appraising the richness and relevance of themes generated by each coding approach, as evaluated by domain experts.\n\n**Main Experimental Results:**\nThe study finds significant enhancements in thematic depth and clarity when adopting the hybrid human-LLM coding approach:\n1. **Inter-Coder Reliability:** Higher agreement rates were observed in the hybrid coding approach compared to LLM-only or traditional human coding methods.\n2. **Thematic Saturation:** The hybrid approach reached thematic saturation more efficiently, suggesting a more comprehensive capture of relevant themes without excessive data redundancy.\n3. **Depth of Insight:** Expert evaluations indicate that the hybrid method uncovers nuanced themes and provides richer, more actionable insights into mental illness stigma.\n"

            "experiment_process": "The methodology starts with human retrospective analysis and deductive coding using a pre-developed codebook. This involves multiple coders and iterations to ensure inter-rater reliability, followed by LLM deductive coding based on the human-developed coding scheme. Different prompts and LLM configurations are tested to identify optimal conditions that yield highest inter-rater reliability with human coders. The next step involves identifying discrepancies between human and LLM codes, followed by collaborative open discussions among coders to resolve these disagreements and code potential new themes.",
            "result_discussion": "Using LLMs for qualitative coding significantly reduces time and effort compared to human coding. However, information from the human codebook is crucial for LLM coding, especially additional rules for challenging codes. Supplementary information beyond codebook has minimal impact on LLM performance. The optimal prompts identified for each attribution achieved high inter-rater reliability: responsibility (0.7), anger (0.65), pity (0.55), fear (0.71), helping (0.69), coercion segregation (0.58), and social distance (0.76). The human-LLM agreement overall was 0.87, demonstrating the reliability of LLM coding.",

Three categories emerged: 51 instances of human coding errors, 41 LLM coding errors, and 181 instances suggesting new codes. Insights were based on human collaborative open discussions, revealing nuances LLMs might miss due to lack of social context awareness.",
