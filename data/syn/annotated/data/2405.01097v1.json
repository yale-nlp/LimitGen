    "title": "Silencing the Risk, Not the Whistle: A Semi-automated Text Sanitization Tool for Mitigating the Risk of Whistleblower Re-Identification",
    "abstract": "Whistleblowing is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in both public and private sectors. However, (potential) whistleblowers often fear or face retaliation, even when reporting anonymously. The specific content of their disclosures and their distinct writing style may re-identify them as the source. Legal measures, such as the EU Whistleblower Directive, are limited in their scope and effectiveness. Therefore, computational methods to prevent re-identification are important complementary tools for encouraging whistleblowers to come forward. However, current text sanitization tools follow a one-size-fits-all approach and take an overly limited view of anonymity. They aim to mitigate identification risk by replacing typical high-risk words (such as person names and other labels of named entities) and combinations thereof with placeholders. Such an approach, however, is inadequate for the whistleblowing scenario since it neglects further re-identification potential in textual features, including the whistleblower\u2019s writing style. Therefore, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel classification and mitigation strategy for rewriting texts that involves the whistleblower in the assessment of the risk and utility. Our prototypical tool semi-automatically evaluates risk at the word/term level and applies risk-adapted anonymization techniques to produce a grammatically disjointed yet appropriately sanitized text. We then use a Large Language Model (LLM) that we fine-tuned for paraphrasing to render this text coherent and style-neutral. We\nevaluate our tool\u2019s effectiveness\nusing\ncourt cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and excerpts from a real-world whistleblower testimony and measure the protection against authorship attribution attacks and utility\nloss statistically using the popular IMDb62 movie reviews dataset, which consists of 62 individuals. Our method can significantly reduce authorship attribution accuracy from 98.81% to 31.22%, while preserving up to 73.1% of the original content\u2019s semantics, as measured by the established cosine similarity of sentence embeddings.",

            "text": "In recent years, whistleblowers have become \u201ca powerful force\u201d for transparency and accountability, not just in the field of AI (Crawford et al., 2019  ###reference_b10###), but also in other technological domains and across both private- and public-sector organizations. Institutions such as the AI Now Institute (Crawford et al., 2019  ###reference_b10###) or the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, 2019  ###reference_b23###) have emphasized the key role of whistleblower protection for societal well-being and often also the organizations\u2019 own interests (Hauser et al., 2019  ###reference_b22###).\nHowever, whistleblowing may be a threat for the organizations whose malfeasance is being revealed; thus (potential) whistleblowers often fear or face retaliation. Computationally-supported anonymous reporting seems to be a way forward, but even if reporting frameworks are sufficiently secure system- and network-wise, the report itself may allow inferences towards the whistleblower\u2019s identity due to its content and the whistleblower\u2019s writing style. Non-partisan organizations such as Whistleblower-Netzwerk e.V. (WBN) provide guidance on concise writing. Our interactions with WBN confirm that whistleblower testimonies often include unnecessary personal details.\nExisting approaches modifying the texts of such reports appear promising, but they take an overly limited view of anonymity and \u2013 like whistleblower protection laws \u2013 address only parts of the problem. This is detailed in Section 2  ###reference_###.\nTo improve on these approaches, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel classification and mitigation strategy for rewriting texts that puts the whistleblower into the loop of assessing risk and utility.\nOur contributions are threefold.\nFirst (Section 3  ###reference_###), we analyse the interleaved contributions of different types of identifiers in texts to derive a description of the problem for anonymous whistleblowing in terms of a trade-off between risk (identifiability of the whistleblower) and utility (of the rewritten text retaining sufficient information on the specific event details).\nWe derive a strategy for assigning re-identification risk levels of concern to textual features composed of an automated mapping and an interactive adjustment of concern levels.\nSecond (Section 4  ###reference_###), we describe our toolwhich implements this strategy. It applies (i) the word/term-to-concern mapping using natural language processing to produce a sanitized but possibly ungrammatical intermediate text version, (ii) a Large Language Model (LLM) that we fine-tuned for paraphrasing to render this text coherent and style-neutral, and (iii) interactivity to draw on the user\u2019s context knowledge.\nThird (Section 5  ###reference_###), we evaluate the resulting\nrisk-utility trade-off. We measure the protection against authorship attribution attacks and utility loss statistically using an established\nbenchmark dataset and show that it can significantly reduce authorship attribution accuracy while retaining utility. We also evaluate our our tool\u2019s effectiveness in masking direct and quasi-identifiers using the Text Anonymization Benchmark (Pil\u00e1n et al., 2022  ###reference_b49###) and demonstrate its effectiveness on excerpts from a real-world whistleblower testimony. Section 6  ###reference_### sketches current limitations and future work. Section 7  ###reference_### describes ethical considerations and researchers\u2019 positionality, and it discusses possible adverse impacts."

            "text": "Whistleblowers play a crucial role in exposing wrongdoings like injustice, corruption, and discrimination in organizations (Near and Miceli, 1985  ###reference_b42###; Bosua et al., 2014  ###reference_b7###). However, their courageous acts often lead to negative consequences, such as subtle harassment and rumors, job loss and blacklisting, and, in extreme cases, even death threats (Martin, 2003  ###reference_b35###; Sawyer et al., 2010  ###reference_b59###; McGlynn III and Richardson, 2014  ###reference_b38###). In Western nations, whistleblowing is largely viewed as beneficial to society (Van Portfliet and Kenny, 2022  ###reference_b67###), leading to protective laws like the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the European Union\u2019s \u201cWhistleblowing Directive\u201d (Directive 2019/1937). The latter, for example, mandates the establishment of safe reporting channels and protection against retaliation. It also requires EU member states to provide whistleblowers with legal, financial, and psychological support. However, the directive faces criticism for its limitations. Notably, it does not cover all public-sector entities (Terracol, 2019  ###reference_b64###, p. 3) and leaves key decisions to member states\u2019 discretion (Abazi, 2020  ###reference_b2###, p. 652). This discretion extends to the absence of mandatory anonymous reporting channels and permits states to disregard cases they consider \u201cclearly minor\u201d, leaving whistleblowers without comprehensive protection for non-material harms like workplace bullying (Terracol, 2019  ###reference_b64###, p. 3). Furthermore, according to White (2018  ###reference_b71###), the directive\u2019s sectoral approach and reliance on a list of specific EU laws causes a patchwork of provisions, creating a complex and possibly confusing legal environment, particularly for those sectors impacting human rights and life-and-death situations.\nLast but not least, organizations often react negatively to whistleblowing due to the stigma of errors, even though recognizing these mistakes would be key to building a culture of responsibility (Berendt and Schiffner, 2022  ###reference_b6###, p. 12) and improving organizations and society (Weingardt, 2004  ###reference_b70###). The reality for whistleblowers is thus fraught with challenges, from navigating legal uncertainties to dealing with public perception (Sachdeva and Chaudhary, 2022  ###reference_b53###; Leite, 2021  ###reference_b27###; Saade, 2023  ###reference_b52###), leaving many whistleblowers with no option but to report their findings anonymously (Rothschild and Miethe, 1999  ###reference_b51###). However, \u201canonymous\u201d reporting channels alone do not guarantee anonymity (Berendt and Schiffner, 2022  ###reference_b6###)."

Of the manifold possible approaches towards this goal, state-of-the-art whistleblowing-support software as well as legal protections (where existing) focus on\nanonymous communications (Berendt and Schiffner, 2022  ###reference_b6###). This, however, does not guarantee anonymous reports. Instead, a whistleblower\u2019s anonymity may still be at risk due to several factors, including: (i) surveillance technology, such as browser cookies, security mechanisms otherwise useful to prevent unauthenticated uses, cameras, or access logs, (ii) the author\u2019s unique writing style, and (iii) the specific content of the message (Marcum and Young, 2019  ###reference_b34###). Berendt and Schiffner (2022  ###reference_b6###) refer to the latter as \u201cepistemic non-anonymizability\u201d,\ni.e., the risk of being identified based on the unique information in a report, particularly when the information is known to only a few individuals. In some cases, this may identify the whistleblower uniquely.\nTerms and their understanding in the domain of anonymity vary. We use the following nomenclature:\nanonymization is a modification of data that increases the size of the anonymity set of the person (or other entity) of interest; conversely, de-anonymization decreases it (to some number . De-anonymization to , which includes the provision of an identifier (e.g., a proper name), is called re-identification. The removal of some identifying information (e.g., proper names), called de-identification, often but not necessarily leads to anonymization (Ben Cheikh Larbi et al., 2022  ###reference_b5###; Weggenmann and Kerschbaum, 2018  ###reference_b69###).\nIn structured data, direct identifiers (e.g., names or social security numbers) are unique to an individual, whereas quasi-identifiers like age, gender, or zip code, though not unique on their own, can be combined to form unique patterns. Established mathematical frameworks for quantifying anonymity, such as Differential Privacy (DP) (Dwork, 2006  ###reference_b17###), and metrics such as k-anonymity (Samarati and Sweeney, 1998  ###reference_b54###), along with their refinements (Machanavajjhala et al., 2007  ###reference_b32###; Li et al., 2006  ###reference_b28###), can be used when anonymizing datasets.\nUnstructured data such as text, which constitutes a vast majority of the world\u2019s data, requires its own safeguarding methods, which fall into two broader categories (Lison et al., 2021  ###reference_b29###). The first, NLP-based text sanitization, focuses on linguistic patterns to reduce (re-)identification risk. The second, privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP), involves methods like noise addition or generalization to comply with pre-defined privacy requirements (Domingo-Ferrer et al., 2016  ###reference_b16###)."

            "text": "De-identification methods in text sanitization mask identifiers,\nprimarily using named entity recognition (NER) techniques. These methods, largely domain-specific, have been particularly influential in clinical data de-identification, as evidenced, for instance, by the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task (Stubbs et al., 2015  ###reference_b63###). However, they do not or only partially address the risk of indirect re-identification (Mehta et al., 2019  ###reference_b39###; Ben Cheikh Larbi et al., 2022  ###reference_b5###). For example, S\u00e1nchez et al. (2012  ###reference_b56###, 2013  ###reference_b57###, 2014  ###reference_b58###) make the simplifying assumption that replacing noun phrases which are rare in domain-specific corpora or on the web with more general ones offers sufficient protection. Others use recurrent neural networks (Dernoncourt et al., 2017  ###reference_b13###; Liu et al., 2017  ###reference_b31###), reinforcement learning (Xu et al., 2019  ###reference_b72###), support vector machines (Uzuner et al., 2008  ###reference_b66###), or pre-trained language models (Johnson et al., 2020  ###reference_b24###) to identify and remove entities that fall into pre-defined categories. However, all of these approaches ignore or significantly underestimate the actual risks of context-based re-identification.\nMore advanced anonymization methods, in turn, also aim to detect and remove identifiers that do not fit into the usual categories of named entities or are hidden within context. For example, Reddy and Knight (2016  ###reference_b50###) detect and obfuscate gender, and Adams et al. (2019  ###reference_b3###) introduce a human-annotated multilingual corpus containing 24 entity types and a pipeline consisting of NER and co-reference resolution to mask these entities. In a more nuanced approach, Papadopoulou et al. (2022  ###reference_b45###) developed a \u201cprivacy-enhanced entity recognizer\u201d that identifies 240 Wikidata properties linked to personal identification. Their approach includes three key measures to evaluate if a noun phrase needs to be masked or replaced by a more general one (Olstad et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###). The first measure uses RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019  ###reference_b30###) to assess how \u201csurprising\u201d an entity is in its context, assuming that more unique entities carry higher privacy risks. The second measure checks if web search results for entity combinations mention the individual in question, indicating potential re-identification risk. Lastly, they use a classifier trained with the Text Anonymization Benchmark (TAB) corpus (Pil\u00e1n et al., 2022  ###reference_b49###) to predict masking needs based on human annotations.\nKleinberg et al.  ###reference_b25###\u2019s (Kleinberg et al., 2022  ###reference_b25###) \u201cTextwash\u201d employs the BERT model, fine-tuned on a dataset of 3717 articles from the British National Corpus, Enron emails, and Wikipedia. The dataset was annotated with\nentity tags such as \u201cPERSON_FIRSTNAME\u201d, \u201cLOCATION\u201d, and an \u201cOTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE\u201d category for indirect re-identification risks, along with a \u201cNONE\u201d category for tokens that are non-re-identifying. A quantitative evaluation (0.93 F1 score for detection accuracy, minimal utility loss in sentiment analysis, and part-of-speech tagging) and its qualitative assessment (82% / 98% success in anonymizing famous / semi-famous individuals) show promise. However, the more recent gpt-3.5-turbo can re-identify 72.6% of the celebrities from Textwash\u2019s qualitative study on the first attempt, highlighting the evolving complexity of mitigating the risk of re-identification in texts (Patsakis and Lykousas, 2023  ###reference_b46###).\nIn PPDP, several privacy models for structured data have been adapted for privacy guarantees in text. While most are theoretical (Lison et al., 2021  ###reference_b29###), \u201cC-sanitise\u201d (S\u00e1nchez and Batet, 2016  ###reference_b55###) determines the disclosure risk of a certain term t on a set of entities to protect (C), given background knowledge K, which by default is the probability of an entity co-occurring with a term t in the web. Additionally, DP techniques have been adapted to text, either for generating synthetic texts (Fernandes et al., 2019  ###reference_b21###) or for obscuring authorship in text documents (Weggenmann and Kerschbaum, 2018  ###reference_b69###). This involves converting text into word embeddings, altering these vectors with DP techniques, and then realigning them to the nearest words in the embedding model (Yue et al., 2021  ###reference_b74###; Zhao and Chen, 2022  ###reference_b75###). However, \u201cword-level differential privacy\u201d (Mattern et al., 2022  ###reference_b36###) faces challenges: it maintains the original sentence length, limiting variation, and can cause grammatical errors, such as replacing nouns with unrelated adjectives, due to not considering word types.\nAuthorship attribution (AA) systems use stylistic features such as vocabulary, syntax, and grammar to identify an author. State-of-the-art approaches involve using Support Vector Machines (Yadav et al., 2020  ###reference_b73###; Tyo et al., 2022  ###reference_b65###), and more recently, fine-tuned LLMs like BertAA (Fabien et al., 2020  ###reference_b19###; Altakrori et al., 2021  ###reference_b4###; Tyo et al., 2022  ###reference_b65###). The \u201cValla\u201d benchmark and software package\nstandardizes evaluation methods and includes fifteen diverse datasets (Tyo et al., 2022  ###reference_b65###). Contrasting this, adversarial stylometry modifies an author\u2019s writing style to reduce AA systems\u2019 effectiveness (Stuart et al., 2013  ###reference_b62###). Advancements in machine translation (Wang et al., 2021  ###reference_b68###) have also introduced new methods based on adversarial training (Shetty et al., 2018  ###reference_b61###), though they sometimes struggle with preserving the original text\u2019s meaning. Semi-automated tools, such as \u201cAnonymouth\u201d (McDonald et al., 2012  ###reference_b37###), propose modifications for anonymity in a user\u2019s writing, requiring a significant corpus of the user\u2019s own texts. Moreover, recent advances in automatic paraphrasing using fine-tuned LLMs demonstrated a notable reduction in authorship attribution, but primarily for shorter texts (Mattern et al., 2022  ###reference_b36###).\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no \u2013 and maybe there can be no \u2013 complete list of textual features contributing to the re-identification of individuals in text.\nAs Narayanan and Shmatikov (2010  ###reference_b41###) highlight, \u201cany attribute can be identifying in combination with others\u201d [p. 3]. In text, we encounter elements like characters, words, and phrases, each carrying varying levels of meaning (Feldman and Sanger, 2007  ###reference_b20###). Single words convey explicit lexical meaning as defined by a vocabulary (e.g. \u201cemployee\u201d), while multiple words are bound by syntactic rules to express more complex thoughts implicitly in phrases (\u201cyoungest employee\u201d) and sentences (\u201cShe is the youngest employee\u201d).\nIn addition, the European Data Protection Supervisor  and Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD)(2021) (EDPS  ###reference_b18###) state that anonymization can never be fully automated and needs to be \u201ctailored to the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons\u201d [p. 7].\nTo take these insights and limitations into account, our semi-automated text sanitization tool leverages insights on the removal of identifying information but involves the whistleblower (the user) in the decision-making process."

At least some of them need to be identified in order for the report to make any sense.\nThe following fictitious example consists of three possible versions of a report in order to illustrate how different types of identifiers may contribute to the re-identification of the anonymously reporting employee Jane Doe, a member of the Colours and Lacquer group in the company COLOURIFICS.\nOn 24 January 2023, John Smith poured polyurethane resin into the clover-leaf-shaped sink of room R23.\nAfter our group meeting on the fourth Tuesday of January 2023, the head of the Colours and Lacquer Group poured a toxin into the sink of room R23.\nSomebody poured a liquid into a recepticle on some date in a room of the company.\nIn V1, \u201cJohn Smith\u201d is the lexical identifier111The classification of identifiers is due to Phillips (Phillips, 2004  ###reference_b48###).

Like John Smith, room R23 is a unique named entity in the context of the company and also identified lexically. \u201cPolyurethane resin\u201d is the lexical identifiers of a toxin (both are common nouns rather than names of individual instances of their category). The \u201cclover-leaf-shaped\u201d serves as a descriptive identifier of the sink. In V2, John Smith is still identifiable via the descriptive identifier \u201chead of the Colours and Lacquer Group\u201d, at least on 24 January 2023 (reconstructed with the help of a calendar and COLOURIFIC\u2019s personnel files). \u201cOur\u201d group meeting is an indexical identifier that signals that the whistleblower is one of the, say five employees in the Colours and Lacquer Group.\nThe indexical information is explicit in V2 given the background knowledge that only employees in this group were co-present (for example, in the company\u2019s key-card logfiles). The same information may be implicit in V1 (if it can be seen from the company\u2019s organigram who John Smith is and who works in his group).\nBoth versions provide for the inference that Jane Doe or any of her four colleagues must have been the whistleblower. If, in addition, only Jane Doe stayed behind \u201cafter the meeting\u201d, that detail in V2 descriptively identifies her uniquely222If John Smith knows that only she observed him, she is also uniquely identified in V1, but for the sake of the analysis, we assume that only recorded data/text constitute the available knowledge..\nV3 contains only identifiers of very general categories. Many other variants are possible (for example, referencing, in a V4, \u201cthe head of our group\u201d, which would enlarge the search space to all groups that had a meeting in R23 that day).\nThe example illustrates the threats (i)-(iii) of Section 2.2  ###reference_###. It also shows\nthat the whistleblower\u2019s \u201canonymity\u201d (or lack thereof) is only one aspect of a more general and graded picture of who and what can be identified directly, indirectly, or not at all \u2013 and what this implies for the whistleblower\u2019s safety as well as for the report\u2019s effectiveness.\nInspired by Domingo-Ferrer\u2019s (Domingo-Ferrer, 2007  ###reference_b15###) three types of (data) privacy, we distinguish between the identifiability of the whistleblower Jane Doe (author\n333We assume that the potential whistleblower is also the author of the report. This is the standard setting. Modifications for the situation in which a trusted third party writes the report on their behalf are the subject of future work.\nidentifiability ) and descriptions of the event or other wrongdoing, including other actors (event details ).\nGiven the stated context knowledge, we obtain an anonymity set of size  for John Smith in V1 and V2. Jane Doe is in an anonymity set of size  or even  in V2. In V1, that set may be of size  (if people routinely work only within their group) or larger (if they may also join other groups). Thus, the presence of a name does not necessarily entail a larger risk.\nBoth are in an anonymity set containing all the company\u2019s employees at the reported date in V3 (assuming no outsiders have access to company premises). The toxin and the sink may be in a smaller anonymity set in V1 than in V2 or V3, and they could increase further (for example, if only certain employees have access to certain substances). Importantly, the identifiability of people and other entities in  can increase the identifiability of the whistleblower.\nV3 illustrates a further challenge: the misspelled receptacle may be a typical error of a specific employee, and the incorrect placement of the temporal before the spatial information suggests that the writer may be a German or Dutch native speaker. In addition to errors, also correct variants carry information that stylometry can use for authorship attribution, which obviously can have a large effect on .\nThe whistleblower would, on the one hand, want to reduce all such identifiabilities as much as possible. On the other hand, the extreme generalization of V3 creates a meaningless report that neither the company nor a court would follow up on. This general problem can be framed in terms of risk and utility, which will be described next."

In a simple world of known repositories of structured data, one could aim at determining the identifying problem (e.g., by database joins to identify the whistleblower due to some attributive information they reveal about themselves and by multiple joins for dependencies such as managers and teams) and compute how large the resulting anonymity set (or  as its inverse) is.

            "text": "Potential whistleblowers would be ill-served by any fully automated tool that claims to be able to deliver a certain mathematically guaranteed anonymization. Instead, we propose to provide them with a semi-automated tool that does have some \u201canonymity-enhancing defaults\u201d that illustrate with the concrete material how textual elements can be identifying and how they can be rendered less identifying. Our tool starts with the heuristic default assumption that identifiability is potentially always problematic and then lets the user steer our tool by specifying how \u201cconcerning\u201d specific individual elements are and choosing, interactively, the treatment of each of them that appears to give the best combination of  and . By letting the author/user assign these final risk scores in the situated context of the evolving text, we enable them to draw on a maximum of implicit context knowledge.\nOur approach and tool proceed through several steps. We first determine typical textual elements that can constitute or be part of the different types of identifiers. As can be seen in Table 1  ###reference_###, most of them can affect  and .\nSince identification by name (or, by extension, pronouns that co-reference names) does not even need additional background knowledge and since individuals are more at risk than generics, we classify some textual features as \u201chighly concerning\u201d, others as having \u201cmedium concern\u201d, and the remainder as \u201cpotentially concerning\u201d.\nWe differentiate between two types of proper nouns. Some names refer to typical \u201cnamed entities\u201d, which include, in particular, specific people, places, and organizations, as well as individual dates and currency amounts. These pose particular person-identification risk in whistleblowing scenarios.555PERSON, GPE (region), LOC (location), EVENT, LAW, LANGUAGE, DATE, TIME, PERCENT, MONEY, QUANTITY, and ORDINAL\n\u201cOther proper nouns\u201d, such as titles of music pieces, books and artworks generally only pose medium risk. For stylometric features, we explicitly categorize out-of-vocabulary words, misspelled words, and words that are surprising given the overall topic of the text. Other low-level stylometric features, such as punctuation patterns, average word and sentence length, or word and phrase repetition, are not (and in many cases, such as with character n-gram pattern, cannot be (Lagutina et al., 2019  ###reference_b26###)) explicitly identified. Instead, we implicitly/indirectly account for them as a byproduct of the LLM-based rephrasing. For all other parts of speech, we propose to use replacement strategies based on data-anonymization operations that are proportional to the risk (Table 2  ###reference_###). Given the complexities of natural language and potential context information, the latter two operations are necessarily heuristic; thus, our tool applies the classification and the risk mitigation strategy as a default which can then be adapted by the user.\nOverview of the approach from identifier types to default risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier Type\n\nTextual Feature\n\n\n\nDefault Risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLexical\n\nNames of named entities\n,\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nLexical\n\nOther proper nouns\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\nIndexical\n\nPronouns\n,\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive\n\nCommon nouns\n,()\n\n\nPotential\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive\n\nModifiers\n,()\n\n\nPotential\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive\n(via pragmatic inferences)\n\nOut-of-vocabulary wordsa\n, ()\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\nMisspelled wordsa\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\nSurprising wordsb\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\nOther stylometric features\n\n\n\nN/Ac\naTreated as noun.\nbNouns or proper nouns.\ncNot explicitly specified.

For example, rephrasing \u201cUSA\u201d as \u201cU.S.A\u201d has the same influence on  as failing to remove \u201cUSA\u201d.\nWe estimate  through SSim. In addition, we determine all entities in the sanitized text that are not in the original text (again using the Levenshtein distance). We categorize them into (1) rephrased harmful entities (semantically identical to at least one entity that should have been masked), (2) rephrased harmless entities, and (3) newly introduced entities. We measure semantic similarity by calculating the cosine similarity of each named entity phrase\u2019s sentence embedding to those in the original text."

Our method can significantly reduce authorship attribution accuracy from 98.81% to 31.22%, while preserving up to 73.1% of the original content\u2019s semantics, as measured by the established cosine similarity sentence embeddings.\nOur qualitative analysis revealed that minor wording changes significantly impact  and , and highlighted our tool\u2019s strengths in reducing  through generalization, perturbation, and suppression.\nOur tool\u2019s usefulness in real-world whistleblowing scenarios remains to be tested, particularly with human users. Challenges arise from the possibility of the tool introducing unrelated entities through model hallucination and its limitations in addressing complex syntactic structures and co-references. Still, our LLM-based approach has proved to be promising in matters of counteracting the limitations of state-of the art approaches. The fine-tuned model effectively reduces authorship attribution and improves text coherence \u2013 two of the main shortcomings of previous works. At the same time, it introduces novel challenges, such as limited control over the accuracy and consistency of the rephrased content.\nFuture work will focus on refining our tool through evaluations involving human participants and domain experts. Given the crucial importance of context knowledge for re-identification risks and the challenges in identifying all textual features that contribute to re-identification, future work will also pay increasing attention to enhancing anonymization awareness. This would not only apply to the whistleblowing use case, but extend to the protection of free speech in other areas too, including journalism, political activism, and social media.\nWe envision an interactive awareness tool as a more dynamic alternative to conventional static writing guides on whistleblowing platforms. This tool would incorporate insights from our research as well as insights from practitioners, aiming to educate users about subtle textual nuances that could pose re-identification risks, thereby creating a deeper understanding and more effective use of anonymization practices in high-risk disclosures.\nAt the same time, we need to draw on practitioners\u2019 and legal experts\u2019 knowledge to better understand what textual changes are detrimental (or conducive) to utility and incorporate these insights into the guidance provided by the awareness tool."

            "text": "In the following paragraphs, we discuss five key challenges, interweaving a potential adverse impacts statement, an ethical considerations statement (what we have done or can do), and positionalities.\nWe are computer scientists (some of us with a background also in social and legal sciences)\nwho have programming expertise (instrumental for mitigating challenges C1\u2013C4), understanding of data protection law (C1), research expertise in bias and fairness, including methods for risk mitigation when working with LLMs (C2), and collaborators with human-subjects studies expertise (C3). None of us has been a whistleblower. We outline below how future collaborators and/or deployers with other positionalities can contribute relevant complementary expertise on C1\u2013C5.\nC1 \u2013 Data Protection:\nOur tool does not collect or store any user data. Original as well as re-written texts are discarded after each run, and they are not used to train the model further. Our tool does not require an internet connection beyond the initial downloading of pre-trained language models and optional queries to Wikidata servers.\nWhile querying Wikidata enhances the efficacy of our tool by enabling the generalization of certain words, users\nshould be aware that these queries might expose confidential information\nto external servers. To mitigate this risk, our implementation remains functional when offline, albeit with slightly reduced efficacy due to the lack of real-time Wikidata look-ups.\nIn a real-life deployment, technical and organizational measures would need to be implemented in order to safeguard the confidential personal or organizational data that remain in the reports; this will also require security and legal expertise.\nC2 \u2013 Bias and (Un-)fairness:\nOur tool may inadvertently introduce or perpetuate biases present in the training data. FLAN T5 was trained on C4, which is generated from the April 2019 Common Crawl dataset. Dodge et al. (2021  ###reference_b14###) discovered that C4 has a \u201cnegative sentiment bias against Arab identities\u201d and excludes \u201cdocuments associated with Black and Hispanic authors\u201d as well as documents \u201cmentioning sexual orientations\u201d [p. 8] by its blocklist filter. Therefore, similar to other pre-trained models (Mao et al., 2022  ###reference_b33###), FLAN T5 is \u201cpotentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases\u201d (Chung et al., 2022  ###reference_b9###, p. 52).\nThis may bias our level of concern measures.\nFor example, certain names, professions, or locations may be classified as \u201cmedium concerning\u201d or \u201chighly concerning\u201d more often because they are considered \u201csurprising\u201d, which may unfairly impact the narratives involving them. Future work should, therefore, include evaluating and mitigating these biases and possibly experiments with other datasets and pre-trained models.\nC3 \u2013 Over-Reliance and Retaliation:\nThe results of our quantitative evaluation are promising, but an extensive qualitative evaluation is necessary to determine whether our approach translates to real-world situations. Therefore, users of our tool must remain aware of its potential to alter the original intent of their text significantly and, depending on the context, possibly offer limited protection against retaliation. Over-reliance on our tool may lead to a false sense of security, resulting in increased vulnerability to retaliation.\nWe intend to assess the extent of this form of\nautomation bias (Cummings, 2004  ###reference_b11###) in a subsequent user study, discuss with people who are working in the field (e.g., whistleblower protection activists) how to best reduce it, and also evaluate these future mitigation measures.\nC4 \u2013 Resource consumption:\nTraining LLMs is resource-intensive. By re-using the existing model and enlisting distilled LLM learning, this impact could be reduced in future work.\nC5\n\u2013 Tool Misuse:\nEven though our tool aims to mitigate the risk of whistleblower re-identification, malicious actors might misuse our tool for obfuscating dangerous information or illegally converting copyrighted material. By providing our source code and fine-tuned models publicly, we open avenues for ethical use and misuse alike. Therefore, we emphasize that our sole aim in developing our tool is to facilitate legal, ethical whistleblowing.\nFuture refinements and real-world evaluations will require collaboration with legal and social experts to better understand the practical implications and potential misuse scenarios."

        "research_background": "### Paper's Motivation\nThe paper aims to address the critical issue of whistleblower re-identification, which poses a significant threat to individuals revealing malfeasance within organizations. Although whistleblowers are crucial for promoting transparency and accountability, they often face retaliation when their identities are uncovered. Current computational and legal frameworks provide limited protection, highlighting the necessity for a more robust solution that ensures anonymity without compromising the utility of the reported information.\n\n### Research Problem\nThe core research problem tackled by the paper is the challenge of protecting whistleblowers' identities through text sanitization in their reports. The concern is that existing computational anonymous reporting systems fail to address the potential for identifiability based on the content and writing style present in the reports. Therefore, the paper seeks to develop a method that allows whistleblowers to provide detailed and useful testimonies while mitigating the risk of their re-identification.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work\n1. **Crawford et al. (2019)**: Emphasizes the importance of whistleblower protection for societal well-being, especially in the context of AI, with institutions like the AI Now Institute highlighting its significance.\n\n2. **IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (2019)**: Points out the ethical considerations of autonomous systems and underscores the need for whistleblower protection.\n\n3. **Hauser et al. (2019)**: Discusses the alignment of whistleblower protection with the interests of both public- and private-sector organizations.\n\n4. **Whistleblower-Netzwerk e.V. (WBN)**: Provides guidance on concise writing to reduce unnecessary personal details, which the authors use to demonstrate the inclusion of superfluous information in whistleblower testimonies.\n\n5. **Pil\u00e1n et al. (2022)**: Introduces the Text Anonymization Benchmark, which is used in the evaluation of the proposed tool's effectiveness in masking identifiers.\n\nThe referenced works collectively emphasize the importance of whistleblowing for transparency and the current inadequacies in protecting the identities of whistleblowers, which motivate the development of a more comprehensive solution.",
        "methodology": "The proposed method in the paper \"Silencing the Risk, Not the Whistle: A Semi-automated Text Sanitization Tool for Mitigating the Risk of Whistleblower Re-Identification\" is detailed in the methodology section. The key components and innovations of this method include:\n\n1. **Problem Statement Derivation**:\n   - The problem statement is derived from an analysis of different identifier types. This involves identifying and categorizing various types of information that could potentially lead to the re-identification of whistleblowers.\n\n2. **Overview of the Approach**:\n   - An overview of the approach is provided, which likely includes a summary of the methodologies, tools, and techniques being used to achieve text sanitization and protect the identities of whistleblowers.\n\n3. **Anonymization Operations for Textual Features**:\n   - The method details specific anonymization operations for textual features. This involves processes and techniques to obscure or remove identifying information within text that could compromise whistleblower anonymity.\n\n4. **Automatic Assignment of Default Concern Levels**:\n   - An automatic system for assigning default concern levels to different pieces of information is implemented. This system likely categorizes information based on its sensitivity and the risk it poses for re-identification.\n\nThese components collectively represent a semi-automated text sanitization tool designed to mitigate the risk of whistleblower re-identification through a combination of manual and automated processes. The innovative aspects include the categorization of identifiers, specific anonymization techniques, and the automation of sensitivity assessment.",

            "research_objective": "Classify and evaluate the suppression consistency and effectiveness of the text sanitization process in identified whistleblower testimonies.",
            "experiment_process": "The study classified different textual elements in the testimonies based on their level of concern (LvC). Identifiers and descriptors deemed highly concerning or mediums of stylometric identifiers were annotated and evaluated. The sanitization effectiveness was then tested by reviewing how these elements were anonymized, using replaced entities or generalized terms, and examining the consistency of these replacements.",
            "result_discussion": "For testimonial excerpts, the sanitization process retained some identifiers but anonymized stylometric identifiers, leading to inconsistencies and general terms that could confuse readers. Specific identifiers were effectively anonymized, but issues like LLM-induced spelling errors and overly broad generalizations were noted. The study emphasized the need for human editing to address these issues, demonstrating the tool's effectiveness while also pointing out areas needing improvement for better real-world applicability.",
