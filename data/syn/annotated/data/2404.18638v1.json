            "text": "The recent inception of Generative Large Language Models into the limelight has significantly influenced and reshaped the applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the ways that LLMs contribute to it Zhao et al. (2023  ###reference_b30###).\nBecause LLMs are trained on a massive set of internet data, this comprehensive knowledge gives them the capabilities to extract semantics and respond coherently in a human-style conversation.\nFurthermore, fine-tuning through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) Ouyang et al. (2022  ###reference_b18###) has enabled LLMs to accurately follow input prompt instructions.\nThese capabilities have allowed LLMs to be used for a variety of out-of-the-box applications, including chatbot agents Dan et al. (2023  ###reference_b3###); Limna et al. (2023  ###reference_b10###), coding Vaithilingam et al. (2022  ###reference_b21###); OpenAI (2023  ###reference_b15###), and general common-sense reasoning Wei et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###).\nIn addition, some studies have shown that LLMs can be further leveraged for knowledge reasoning in professional domains such as in medical Li\u00e9vin et al. (2022  ###reference_b9###) and legal Hakimi Parizi et al. (2023  ###reference_b4###) fields.\nIn RL problems, one goal can be to optimize an objective function (e.g., the sum of the expected long-term rewards) as an agent interacts with the environment and receives feedback.\nDeep RL Mnih et al. (2015  ###reference_b11###), a paradigm that implements the agent or policy with a deep learning model, has gained attention as a function approximator to implement RL agents and policies.\nOnce the Deep RL model is trained, it can receive a set of observations as inputs, and output the corresponding action to navigate the agent to the next state.\nRL agents, and their policy implementations as RL models, do not necessarily have well-defined natural language interfaces, which limits their implementation accessibility to non-technical users.\nTo this aim, prior work Woodward et al. (2020  ###reference_b25###) has explored the advantages of expanding the RL agent interfaces to unstructured formats and has achieved improved task performance.\nIn parallel, LLM-based prompting has introduced a new interaction paradigm between AI systems and end-users that is more intuitive and accessible to every-day and non-technical users.\nIn addition, recent developments in prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting Wei et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###), have improved LLMs\u2019 abilities to decompose complex tasks into manageable substeps and further enhance their reasoning and planning capabilities.\nThis motivates the exploration of whether RL problems can be interactively solved through iterative prompting of the LLMs.\nBased on a set of input and output requirements for the RL task at hand, the LLM can arguably execute the task, evaluate whether the requirements are fully met, and determine if additional iterations are required to satisfy all the requirements.\nSubsequently, the interesting question of whether the embedded knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged through iterative prompting to allow LLMs to function as RL agents remains unanswered.\nConsequently, in this research, we propose a new framework that leverages the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs to align them for RL problem-solving.\nFor this process, we leverage the latest paradigm of human and AI systems interactions, i.e., natural language prompting of LLMs.\nMore specifically, we make the following contributions:\nWe introduce an iterative prompting strategy for communicating with LLMs and formulate RL problems based on Markov Decision Process and Q-Learning into LLM prompting tasks.\nWe then iteratively leverage the LLM\u2019s knowledge and self-reflection to optimize the RL problem and extract the desired output from the LLM.\nWe propose the integration of episode generation and simulation into the prompting chain and thus enable LLM-based policy learning, and, subsequently, we solicit the optimal policy outcomes (i.e., episodes) from the LLM.\nWe provide two detailed case studies of how our approach can be effectively implemented to extract optimal policies for the Research Scientist and Legal Matter Intake workflows."

(2021  ###reference_b7###) proposed an RL formulation via a sequence-to-sequence learning model based on the transformers architecture.\nHowever, this modeling lacks the more accessible natural language and prompt-based interactions with LLMs and human users.\nConsequently, recent studies have explored building RL agents with LLMs or enabling interactions between LLMs and RL agents to improve the accomplishment of specific tasks, to name a few, robot control Hu et al. (2023  ###reference_b6###) and game playing Xu et al. (2023  ###reference_b27###).\nPrior work has shown prompt engineering scenarios can help in decomposing complex tasks and thus reach better outcomes with LLMs.\nWei et al. Wei et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###) introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which prompts the LLM to solve a task in a step-by-step manner.\nSimilarly, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Yao et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) Besta et al. (2023  ###reference_b2###) expand on CoT and create tree and graph structures of prompts, such that different paths of the tree can break down the task into varied sets of smaller substeps.\nOn an adjacent track, self-reflection prompting Shinn et al. (2023  ###reference_b20###) aims to iteratively refine the output of the LLM and get closer to the desired output.\nOur approach is different from the aforementioned prompting methods as we introduce a framework for solving RL tasks with iterative prompting techniques that take into consideration the requirements of reaching an optimal RL policy.\nIn essence, compared to prior approaches, we argue that our approach to successfully implementing natural language and prompt-based interactions with LLMs would be a more intuitive and potentially transformative method for interactions between human users and AI systems.\nThus, it naturally represents the forthcoming paradigm for optimizing RL problems."

        "research_background": "### Motivation:\n\nThe motivation behind this research arises from the recent advances in Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their profound capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Due to their comprehensive training on vast internet data, LLMs can understand semantics and generate coherent responses in human-like conversations. Further, through fine-tuning methods like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), LLMs have been adeptly following input instructions, making them suitable for diverse applications. This inspires the exploration of leveraging LLMs' strengths in reasoning and problem-solving for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks, particularly through iterative prompting strategies, to make RL more accessible and intuitive for non-technical users.\n\n### Research Problem:\n\nThe core research problem addressed by this paper is whether the embedded knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be harnessed to solve RL problems interactively through iterative prompting. Specifically, the paper aims to develop a framework that allows LLMs to function effectively as RL agents. This involves translating traditional RL tasks, exemplified by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Q-Learning, into prompting tasks that LLMs can comprehend and act upon iteratively to optimize the RL problem-solving process.\n\n### Relevant Prior Work:\n\n1. **Influence of LLMs in NLP:**\n   - Zhao et al.

        "methodology": "### Methodology: Reinforcement Learning Problem Solving with Large Language Models\n\n#### Overview\nWe propose a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems by framing them as prompting tasks. The core idea is to exploit the internal knowledge embedded within LLMs to train a Q-Learning RL agent and, consequently, to optimize the desired policy.\n\n#### Steps to Implement the Method\n\n1. **Translate RL Requirements into Prompts:**\n   - Initially, the RL problem's requirements need to be clearly communicated to the LLM through well-defined text-based prompts.\n   - This involves translating the RL problem into a series of prompts designed to extract the required outputs (e.g., optimized policy) from the LLM.\n\n2. **Define Problem Context:**\n   - Set the problem context explicitly for the LLM. This context includes expected behavior and outlines the inputs for the Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based RL problem.\n   - Proper context setup ensures that the LLM can correctly interpret and respond to the RL problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n3. **Specify RL Task:**\n   - Define the RL task that the LLM is intended to optimize. The tasks can be arbitrary; for instance, optimizing the \u201cWorkflow of a research scientist.\u201d\n   - Provide necessary inputs (states, actions, and rewards) to formulate the task as an MDP-based RL problem. Additional parameters, such as discount factors (\u03b3) and learning rates (\u03b1), can be specified if needed. If not specified, the LLM will infer these parameters.\n\n4. **Episode Simulation Using LLM:**\n   - Due to the high cost and time requirements of real-world interactions, the LLM is leveraged to simulate the environment.\n   - The LLM generates episodes, starting from an initial state and ending at a terminal state. These simulated episodes are crucial for the Q-Learning process.\n   - Generated episodes from the LLM serve as the experiential data necessary for training the Q-Learning RL agent.\n\n5. **Instructing the LLM for Q-Learning Outputs:**\n   - The LLM is instructed to return the Q table and values for the optimal episode.\n   - The returned Q table and values are then evaluated to ensure the framework achieves the optimal policy.\n   - Iterative fine-tuning and self-reflection mechanisms (as noted in Shinn et al., 2023) are employed to improve the alignment of LLM outputs with the intended tasks. Iterations continue until the required optimal policy is retrieved or until a predefined maximum number of trials is reached.\n\n#### Summary\nThis methodology involves a comprehensive shift from traditional RL problem-solving by integrating the strengths of LLMs. The innovation lies in:\n- Framing RL problems as prompting tasks for LLMs.\n- Utilizing LLMs not just as optimizers but also as simulators of the RL environment.\n- Iteratively refining outputs using mechanisms similar to self-reflection to better align with the intended tasks.\n\nThe goal is to harness the LLM's encapsulated knowledge to efficiently solve RL problems, providing an innovative and potentially more resource-efficient method compared to conventional RL training paradigms.",
