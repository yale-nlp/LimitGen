Compare the following pair of limitations of a scientific paper: one generated and one from the ground truth. Assess the degree of relatedness and the level of specificity of the generated limitation compared to the ground truth limitation.

# Rating Criteria:
## Relatedness

- High: The generated limitation discusses the exact same content as the ground truth.
- Medium: The generated limitation is related to the ground truth, but not exactly the same.
- Weak: The generated limitation is only loosely connected to the ground truth or discusses tangentially related content.
- None: There is no relevant connection between the generated limitation and the ground truth.

## Specificity

- More: The generated limitation provides more detailed or specific information than the ground truth.
- Same: The generated limitation provides a similar level of detail as the ground truth.
- Less: The generated limitation is less detailed or more general compared to the ground truth.

# Ground truth limitation: 
{ground_truth}

# Generated limitation: 
{generated_limitation}
