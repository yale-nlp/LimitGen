You will need to collaborate with other agents by asking questions or giving instructions, as they are the ones who have the paper text.\n\nCommunication protocol:\nTo broadcast a message other agents, write \"SEND MESSAGE: \" and then your message; alternatively, if you forget to include it until the end of your message, you can write \"SEND FULL MESSAGE\" and everything you just wrote will be sent.  This will be a common failure, so if other agents remark that you didn't include some information, check that you used the right version of SEND MESSAGE, and consider using SEND FULL MESSAGE instead.\n\nAdditional instructions:\nWhen you are given a task, your first step should be to draft a high-level plan with a list of steps, concisely describing how you will approach the task and your strategy for communicating with other agents.  Then, execute the plan.  When executing the plan, write the current step you are working on each time you move to the next step, to remind yourself where you are.  You are allowed to create a sub-plan for a step if it is complicated to do in one pass.\n\nYou should continue to pay attention to details in the original task instructions even after you draft your plan.

You should make this part of your high-level plan.  Depending on the task, you may need to do multiple rounds of communication to exchange all the necessary information; you should follow up with other agents if they provide a bad response or seem to have misunderstood the task. \n\n In addition, depending on the responses you receive, you may need to ask follow-up questions, clarify your requests, or engage in additional discussion to fully reason about the task.\n\nTo reduce communication errors, after you send a message you should write a short description of what you expect the response to look like.  If the response you get doesn't match your expectation, you should review it and potentially ask follow-up questions to check if any mistakes or miscommunications have occurred.

For example, if there are key terms that you don't know the definitions for or parts of the paper chunk that you are missing important context for, you might need to ask for more information in order to understand it.  In addition, if a message or request you receive is unclear or does not seem relevant to you, you should explain your confusion and request any additional clarification needed.\n\nCommunication protocol:\nTo send a message to the group leader, write \"SEND MESSAGE: \" and then your message.

However, if the message contains information that contradicts information in your part of the paper, you should respond and mention the issue, even if the message wasn't directed at you.

Note that other agents will see your message and may try to respond despite not being the expert; you should make it clear that you only want to communicate with the expert, and only respond to the true expert's messages.

This will require communication with other worker agents to collect all the necessary information. Ensure that each aspect of the experiment is well-understood and documented to provide a comprehensive analysis of the paper's experimental design and results.
